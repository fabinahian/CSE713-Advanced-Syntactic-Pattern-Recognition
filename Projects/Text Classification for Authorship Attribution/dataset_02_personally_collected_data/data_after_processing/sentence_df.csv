﻿Chapter I.,charles
"My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip.",charles
"So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.",charles
"I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his
tombstone and my sister,—Mrs.",charles
"Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.",charles
"As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of
either of them (for their days were long before the days of
photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones.",charles
"The shape of the letters on
my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,
with curly black hair.",charles
"From the character and turn of the inscription,
“_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,” I drew a childish conclusion that
my mother was freckled and sickly.",charles
"To five little stone lozenges, each
about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that
universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously
entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state
of existence.",charles
"Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river
wound, twenty miles of the sea.",charles
"My first most vivid and broad
impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on
a memorable raw afternoon towards evening.",charles
"At such a time I found out
for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the
churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also
Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,
Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the
aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness
beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,
with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low
leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from
which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of
shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.",charles
"“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch.",charles
"“Keep still, you
little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”

A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg.",charles
"A man
with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
head.",charles
"A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose
teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.",charles
“Oh!,charles
"Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror.",charles
"“Pray don’t do it,
sir.”

“Tell us your name!” said the man.",charles
"“Quick!”

“Pip, sir.”

“Once more,” said the man, staring at me.",charles
"“Give it mouth!”

“Pip.",charles
"Pip, sir.”

“Show us where you live,” said the man.",charles
"“Pint out the place!”

I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.",charles
"The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
emptied my pockets.",charles
There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.,charles
"When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he
made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.",charles
"[Illustration]

“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks you
ha’ got.”

I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
years, and not strong.",charles
"“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shake
of his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”

I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to the
tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;
partly, to keep myself from crying.",charles
“Now lookee here!” said the man.,charles
"“Where’s your mother?”

“There, sir!” said I.",charles
"He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.",charles
"“There, sir!” I timidly explained.",charles
“Also Georgiana.,charles
"That’s my mother.”

“Oh!” said he, coming back.",charles
"“And is that your father alonger your
mother?”

“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”

“Ha!” he muttered then, considering.",charles
"“Who d’ye live with,—supposin’
you’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind about?”

“My sister, sir,—Mrs.",charles
"Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,
sir.”

“Blacksmith, eh?” said he.",charles
And looked down at his leg.,charles
"After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to
my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he
could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,
and mine looked most helplessly up into his.",charles
"“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to be
let to live.",charles
"You know what a file is?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And you know what wittles is?”

“Yes, sir.”

After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
greater sense of helplessness and danger.",charles
“You get me a file.” He tilted me again.,charles
"“And you get me wittles.” He
tilted me again.",charles
“You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again.,charles
"“Or
I’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.",charles
"I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both
hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,
sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”

He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock.",charles
"Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright
position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—

“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles.",charles
"You
bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder.",charles
"You do it, and
you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your
having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall
be let to live.",charles
"You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no
matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore
out, roasted, and ate.",charles
"Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.",charles
"There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I
am a Angel.",charles
That young man hears the words I speak.,charles
"That young man has
a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his
heart, and at his liver.",charles
"It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide
himself from that young man.",charles
"A boy may lock his door, may be warm in
bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think
himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and
creep his way to him and tear him open.",charles
"I am a keeping that young man
from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty.",charles
"I
find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside.",charles
"Now, what
do you say?”

I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken
bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in
the morning.",charles
“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.,charles
"I said so, and he took me down.",charles
"“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and you
remember that young man, and you get home!”

“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.",charles
"“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat.",charles
"“I
wish I was a frog.",charles
"Or a eel!”

At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his
arms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped
towards the low church wall.",charles
"As I saw him go, picking his way among the
nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,
stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his
ankle and pull him in.",charles
"When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me.",charles
"When
I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of
my legs.",charles
"But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on
again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and
picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into
the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were
heavy or the tide was in.",charles
"The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not
nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.",charles
"On the edge of the
river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the
beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a
pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with
some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.",charles
"The man was
limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,
and come down, and going back to hook himself up again.",charles
"It gave me a
terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their
heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too.",charles
"I
looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of
him.",charles
"But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.",charles
Chapter II.,charles
"My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours
because she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find
out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a
hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her
husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both
brought up by hand.",charles
"She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand.",charles
"Joe
was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to
have somehow got mixed with their own whites.",charles
"He was a mild,
good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort
of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.",charles
"My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.",charles
"She was tall
and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her
figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in
front, that was stuck full of pins and needles.",charles
"She made it a powerful
merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this
apron so much.",charles
"Though I really see no reason why she should have worn
it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken
it off, every day of her life.",charles
"Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of
the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time.",charles
"When I
ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was
sitting alone in the kitchen.",charles
"Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and
having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment
I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,
sitting in the chimney corner.",charles
“Mrs.,charles
"Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip.",charles
"And she’s
out now, making it a baker’s dozen.”

“Is she?”

“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”

At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.",charles
"Tickler
was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame.",charles
"“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at
Tickler, and she Ram-paged out.",charles
"That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
it; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”

“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species
of child, and as no more than my equal.",charles
"“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on the
Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.",charles
She’s a-coming!,charles
"Get
behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”

I took the advice.",charles
"My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,
and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,
and applied Tickler to its further investigation.",charles
"She concluded by
throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to
get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly
fenced me up there with his great leg.",charles
"“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her
foot.",charles
"“Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away with
fret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if you
was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”

“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and
rubbing myself.",charles
“Churchyard!” repeated my sister.,charles
"“If it warn’t for me you’d have been
to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.",charles
"Who brought you up by
hand?”

“You did,” said I.",charles
"“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.",charles
"I whimpered, “I don’t know.”

“_I_ don’t!” said my sister.",charles
“I’d never do it again!,charles
I know that.,charles
"I may
truly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.",charles
"It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) without
being your mother.”

My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at
the fire.",charles
"For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me
in the avenging coals.",charles
"“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.",charles
"“Churchyard,
indeed!",charles
"You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,
had not said it at all.",charles
"“You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt
you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be without
me!”

As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me
over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed.",charles
"After that, he sat feeling his
right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with
his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.",charles
"My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,
that never varied.",charles
"First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and
sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.",charles
"Then she
took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,
in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using
both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and
moulding the butter off round the crust.",charles
"Then, she gave the knife a
final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very
thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the
loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.",charles
"On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.",charles
"I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man.",charles
"I knew
Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.",charles
"Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of
my trousers.",charles
"The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
found to be quite awful.",charles
"It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.",charles
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.,charles
"In our
already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his
good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each
other’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.",charles
"To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast
diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he
found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my
untouched bread and butter on the other.",charles
"At last, I desperately
considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had
best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances.",charles
"I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at
me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.",charles
"Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he
didn’t seem to enjoy.",charles
"He turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like
a pill.",charles
"He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone.",charles
"The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of
his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’s
observation.",charles
"“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.",charles
"“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance.",charles
"“Pip, old chap!",charles
You’ll do yourself a mischief.,charles
"It’ll
stick somewhere.",charles
"You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”

“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.",charles
"“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do
it,” said Joe, all aghast.",charles
"“Manners is manners, but still your elth’s
your elth.”

By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,
and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little
while against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking
guiltily on.",charles
"“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out of
breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”

Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and
looked at me again.",charles
"“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,
and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,
any time.",charles
"But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”

“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.",charles
"“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,
with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your
age—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I never
see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolted
dead.”

My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying
nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”

Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine
medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.",charles
"At the
best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a
choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like
a new fence.",charles
"On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded
a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater
comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be
held in a bootjack.",charles
"Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to
swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from
myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had
none before.",charles
"Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in
the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great
punishment.",charles
"The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I
never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.",charles
"Then,
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the
voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until
to-morrow, but must be fed now.",charles
"At other times, I thought, What if the
young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his
hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should
mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and
liver to-night, instead of to-morrow!",charles
"If ever anybody’s hair stood on
end with terror, mine must have done so then.",charles
"But, perhaps, nobody’s
ever did?",charles
"It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with
a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.",charles
"I tried it with
the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the
bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.",charles
"Happily I slipped
away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.",charles
"“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final
warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great
guns, Joe?”

“Ah!” said Joe.",charles
"“There’s another conwict off.”

“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.

Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
“Escaped.",charles
Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.,charles
"While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my
mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?” Joe put
_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,
that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”

“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after
sunset-gun.",charles
And they fired warning of him.,charles
"And now it appears they’re
firing warning of another.”

“_Who’s_ firing?” said I.",charles
"“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,
“what a questioner he is.",charles
"Ask no questions, and you’ll be told no
lies.”

It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
told lies by her even if I did ask questions.",charles
"But she never was polite
unless there was company.",charles
"At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a
word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to
Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe
wouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,
and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.",charles
"But I could make
nothing of the word.",charles
“Mrs.,charles
"Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if you
wouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”

“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite mean
that but rather the contrary.",charles
"“From the Hulks!”

“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe.",charles
"“Hulks!”

Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”

“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.",charles
"“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me out
with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me.",charles
"“Answer him one
question, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly.",charles
"Hulks are prison-ships,
right ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in our
country.",charles
"“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there?” said
I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.",charles
"It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose.",charles
"“I tell you what,
young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badger
people’s lives out.",charles
"It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.",charles
"People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,
and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking
questions.",charles
"Now, you get along to bed!”

I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went
upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe’s thimble
having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—I
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me.",charles
I was clearly on my way there.,charles
"I had begun by asking
questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.",charles
"Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.",charles
"No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror.",charles
"I was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in
mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal
terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had
no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me
at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on
requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.",charles
"If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate
calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the
gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once, and not put it off.",charles
"I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been
inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob
the pantry.",charles
"There was no doing it in the night, for there was no
getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have
struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very
pirate himself rattling his chains.",charles
"As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was
shot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,
and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get
up, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied
than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare
hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back
was half turned, winking.",charles
"I had no time for verification, no time for
selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.",charles
"I stole
some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I
tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), some
brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had
secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,
Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from
a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and
a beautiful round compact pork pie.",charles
"I was nearly going away without the
pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that
was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,
and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not
intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.",charles
"There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I
unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.",charles
"Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which
I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the
misty marshes.",charles
Chapter III.,charles
"It was a rimy morning, and very damp.",charles
"I had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there
all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief.",charles
"Now, I saw
the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort
of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.",charles
﻿CHAPTER I.,charles
"TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH


Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons
it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will
assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,
great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on
a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as
it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of
the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is
prefixed to the head of this chapter.",charles
"For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable
doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which
case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never
have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of
pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the
most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the
literature of any age or country.",charles
"Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a
workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance
that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this
particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could
by possibility have occurred.",charles
"The fact is, that there was considerable
difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of
respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered
necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a
little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and
the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.",charles
"Now, if,
during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful
grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of
profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been
killed in no time.",charles
"There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old
woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;
and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and
Nature fought out the point between them.",charles
"The result was, that, after a
few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to
the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been
imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer
space of time than three minutes and a quarter.",charles
"As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his
lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly
from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,
“Let me see the child, and die.”

The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:
giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.",charles
"As the
young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed’s head, said, with
more kindness than might have been expected of him:

“Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.”

“Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily
depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which
she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.",charles
"“Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,
and had thirteen children of her own, and all on ’em dead except two,
and them in the wurkus with me, she’ll know better than to take on in
that way, bless her dear heart!",charles
"Think what it is to be a mother,
there’s a dear young lamb do.”

Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother’s prospects failed
in producing its due effect.",charles
"The patient shook her head, and stretched
out her hand towards the child.",charles
The surgeon deposited it in her arms.,charles
"She imprinted her cold white lips
passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed
wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died.",charles
"They chafed her breast,
hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.",charles
"They talked of
hope and comfort.",charles
They had been strangers too long.,charles
"“It’s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!” said the surgeon at last.",charles
"“Ah, poor dear, so it is!” said the nurse, picking up the cork of the
green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to
take up the child.",charles
"“Poor dear!”

“You needn’t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,” said
the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.",charles
"“It’s very
likely it _will_ be troublesome.",charles
"Give it a little gruel if it is.” He
put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,
added, “She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?”

“She was brought here last night,” replied the old woman, “by the
overseer’s order.",charles
She was found lying in the street.,charles
"She had walked
some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came
from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.”

The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.",charles
"“The old
story,” he said, shaking his head: “no wedding-ring, I see.",charles
Ah!,charles
"Good-night!”

The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair
before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.",charles
"What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist
was!",charles
"Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only
covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it
would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him
his proper station in society.",charles
"But now that he was enveloped in the old
calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged
and ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan
of a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and
buffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none.",charles
Oliver cried lustily.,charles
"If he could have known that he was an orphan,
left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he
would have cried the louder.",charles
CHAPTER II.,charles
"TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST’S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD


For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic
course of treachery and deception.",charles
He was brought up by hand.,charles
"The
hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported
by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.",charles
"The parish
authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether
there was no female then domiciled in “the house” who was in a
situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of
which he stood in need.",charles
"The workhouse authorities replied with
humility, that there was not.",charles
"Upon this, the parish authorities
magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be “farmed,”
or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse
some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders
against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the
inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental
superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and
for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.",charles
"Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child;
a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to
overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.",charles
"The elderly female was
a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;
and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.",charles
"So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own
use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter
allowance than was originally provided for them.",charles
"Thereby finding in the
lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
experimental philosopher.",charles
"Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who
demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw
a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,
four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable
bait of air.",charles
"Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the
female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a
similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at
the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest
possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen
in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want
and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by
accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was
usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers
it had never known in this.",charles
"Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,
or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a
washing—though the latter accident was very scarce, anything
approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm—the jury
would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the
parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a
remonstrance.",charles
"But these impertinences were speedily checked by the
evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of
whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was
very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever
the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.",charles
"Besides, the board
made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the
day before, to say they were going.",charles
"The children were neat and clean to
behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!",charles
"It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any
very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.",charles
"Oliver Twist’s ninth birthday
found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and
decidedly small in circumference.",charles
"But nature or inheritance had
implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver’s breast.",charles
"It had had plenty of
room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and
perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth
birth-day at all.",charles
"Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth
birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party
of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a
sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be
hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly
startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo
the wicket of the garden-gate.",charles
“Goodness gracious!,charles
"Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?” said Mrs. Mann,
thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.",charles
"“(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash ’em
directly.",charles
)—My heart alive!,charles
"Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,
sure-ly!”

Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of
responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave
the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick
which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle’s.",charles
"“Lor, only think,” said Mrs. Mann, running out,—for the three boys had
been removed by this time,—“only think of that!",charles
"That I should have
forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them
dear children!",charles
"Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.”

Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the
beadle.",charles
"“Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,” inquired
Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, “to keep the parish officers a waiting
at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with
the porochial orphans?",charles
"Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may
say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?”

“I’m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear
children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,” replied Mrs.
Mann with great humility.",charles
"Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his
importance.",charles
"He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other.",charles
"He
relaxed.",charles
"“Well, well, Mrs. Mann,” he replied in a calmer tone; “it may be as you
say; it may be.",charles
"Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and
have something to say.”

Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;
placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and
cane on the table before him.",charles
"Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the
perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the
cocked hat, and smiled.",charles
"Yes, he smiled.",charles
"Beadles are but men: and Mr.
Bumble smiled.",charles
"“Now don’t you be offended at what I’m a going to say,” observed Mrs.
Mann, with captivating sweetness.",charles
"“You’ve had a long walk, you know, or
I wouldn’t mention it.",charles
"Now, will you take a little drop of somethink,
Mr. Bumble?”

“Not a drop.",charles
"Nor a drop,” said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a
dignified, but placid manner.",charles
"“I think you will,” said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.",charles
"“Just a leetle drop,
with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.”

Mr. Bumble coughed.",charles
"“Now, just a leetle drop,” said Mrs. Mann persuasively.",charles
“What is it?” inquired the beadle.,charles
"“Why, it’s what I’m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put
into the blessed infants’ Daffy, when they ain’t well, Mr. Bumble,”
replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a
bottle and glass.",charles
“It’s gin.,charles
"I’ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It’s gin.”

“Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?” inquired Bumble, following
with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.",charles
"“Ah, bless ’em, that I do, dear as it is,” replied the nurse.",charles
"“I
couldn’t see ’em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.”

“No”; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; “no, you could not.",charles
"You are a humane
woman, Mrs. Mann.” (Here she set down the glass.)",charles
"“I shall take a early
opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.” (He drew it
towards him.)",charles
"“You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.” (He stirred the
gin-and-water.)",charles
"“I—I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann”;
and he swallowed half of it.",charles
"“And now about business,” said the beadle, taking out a leathern
pocket-book.",charles
"“The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine
year old today.”

“Bless him!” interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the
corner of her apron.",charles
"“And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was
afterwards increased to twenty pound.",charles
"Notwithstanding the most
superlative, and, I may say, supernat’ral exertions on the part of this
parish,” said Bumble, “we have never been able to discover who is his
father, or what was his mother’s settlement, name, or condition.”

Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment’s
reflection, “How comes he to have any name at all, then?”

The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, “I inwented it.”

“You, Mr. Bumble!”

“I, Mrs. Mann.",charles
We name our fondlings in alphabetical order.,charles
"The last
was a S,—Swubble, I named him.",charles
"This was a T,—Twist, I named _him_.",charles
"The
next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.",charles
"I have got names
ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it
again, when we come to Z.”

“Why, you’re quite a literary character, sir!” said Mrs. Mann.",charles
"“Well, well,” said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;
“perhaps I may be.",charles
"Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.” He finished the
gin-and-water, and added, “Oliver being now too old to remain here, the
board have determined to have him back into the house.",charles
"I have come out
myself to take him there.",charles
"So let me see him at once.”

“I’ll fetch him directly,” said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that
purpose.",charles
"Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of
dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed
off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent
protectress.",charles
"“Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,” said Mrs. Mann.",charles
"Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,
and the cocked hat on the table.",charles
"“Will you go along with me, Oliver?” said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic
voice.",charles
"Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had
got behind the beadle’s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a
furious countenance.",charles
"He took the hint at once, for the fist had been
too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his
recollection.",charles
“Will she go with me?” inquired poor Oliver.,charles
"“No, she can’t,” replied Mr. Bumble.",charles
"“But she’ll come and see you
sometimes.”

This was no very great consolation to the child.",charles
"Young as he was,
however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at
going away.",charles
"It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears
into his eyes.",charles
"Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you
want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.",charles
"Mrs. Mann gave him
a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece
of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the
workhouse.",charles
"With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little
brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.
Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never
lighted the gloom of his infant years.",charles
"And yet he burst into an agony
of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him.",charles
"Wretched as
were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were
the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in
the great wide world, sank into the child’s heart for the first time.",charles
"Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping
his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every
quarter of a mile whether they were “nearly there.” To these
interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for
the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had
by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.",charles
"Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old
woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him
that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.",charles
"Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,
Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite
certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.",charles
"He had no time to think about
the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with
his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively:
and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed
room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table.",charles
"At
the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the
rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.",charles
"“Bow to the board,” said Bumble.",charles
"Oliver brushed away two or three tears
that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,
fortunately bowed to that.",charles
"“What’s your name, boy?” said the gentleman in the high chair.",charles
"Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him
tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him
cry.",charles
"These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating
voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.",charles
"Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite
at his ease.",charles
"“Boy,” said the gentleman in the high chair, “listen to me.",charles
"You know
you’re an orphan, I suppose?”

“What’s that, sir?” inquired poor Oliver.",charles
"“The boy _is_ a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white
waistcoat.",charles
“Hush!” said the gentleman who had spoken first.,charles
"“You know you’ve got
no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don’t
you?”

“Yes, sir,” replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.",charles
"“What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white
waistcoat.",charles
And to be sure it was very extraordinary.,charles
"What _could_ the
boy be crying for?",charles
"“I hope you say your prayers every night,” said another gentleman in a
gruff voice; “and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of
you—like a Christian.”

“Yes, sir,” stammered the boy.",charles
"The gentleman who spoke last was
unconsciously right.",charles
"It would have been very like a Christian, and a
marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people
who fed and took care of _him_.",charles
"But he hadn’t, because nobody had
taught him.",charles
“Well!,charles
"You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,”
said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.",charles
"“So you’ll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six o’clock,” added
the surly one in the white waistcoat.",charles
"For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process
of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and
was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he
sobbed himself to sleep.",charles
"What a novel illustration of the tender laws
of England!",charles
They let the paupers go to sleep!,charles
Poor Oliver!,charles
"He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy
unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day
arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence
over all his future fortunes.",charles
But they had.,charles
"And this was it:

The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and
when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out
at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered—the poor
people liked it!",charles
"It was a regular place of public entertainment for the
poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public
breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and
mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.",charles
"“Oho!” said the
board, looking very knowing; “we are the fellows to set this to rights;
we’ll stop it all, in no time.” So, they established the rule, that all
poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody,
not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a
quick one out of it.",charles
"With this view, they contracted with the
water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a
corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and
issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and
half a roll of Sundays.",charles
"They made a great many other wise and humane
regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary
to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in
consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors’ Commons; and,
instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had
theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a
bachelor!",charles
"There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under
these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,
if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were
long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.",charles
"The relief was
inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened
people.",charles
"For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was
in full operation.",charles
"It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of
the increase in the undertaker’s bill, and the necessity of taking in
the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their
wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two’s gruel.",charles
"But the number of
workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were
in ecstasies.",charles
"The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a
copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the
purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at
mealtimes.",charles
"Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and
no more—except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two
ounces and a quarter of bread besides.",charles
The bowls never wanted washing.,charles
"The boys polished them with their
spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this
operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large
as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager
eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was
composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers
most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of
gruel that might have been cast thereon.",charles
"Boys have generally excellent
appetites.",charles
"Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of
slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and
wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn’t
been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small
cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another
basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to
eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of
tender age.",charles
"He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed
him.",charles
"A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the
master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to
Oliver Twist.",charles
The evening arrived; the boys took their places.,charles
"The master, in his
cook’s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants
ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long
grace was said over the short commons.",charles
"The gruel disappeared; the boys
whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors
nudged him.",charles
"Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless
with misery.",charles
"He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin
and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:

“Please, sir, I want some more.”

The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale.",charles
"He gazed in
stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then
clung for support to the copper.",charles
"The assistants were paralysed with
wonder; the boys with fear.",charles
"“What!” said the master at length, in a faint voice.",charles
"“Please, sir,” replied Oliver, “I want some more.”

The master aimed a blow at Oliver’s head with the ladle; pinioned him
in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.",charles
"The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into
the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high
chair, said,

“Mr.",charles
"Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!",charles
"Oliver Twist has asked for
more!”

There was a general start.",charles
Horror was depicted on every countenance.,charles
“For _more_!” said Mr. Limbkins.,charles
"“Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer
me distinctly.",charles
"Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had
eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?”

“He did, sir,” replied Bumble.",charles
"“That boy will be hung,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",charles
"“I
know that boy will be hung.”

Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman’s opinion.",charles
"An animated
discussion took place.",charles
"Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and
a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a
reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the
hands of the parish.",charles
"In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were
offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,
business, or calling.",charles
"“I never was more convinced of anything in my life,” said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill
next morning: “I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than
I am that that boy will come to be hung.”

As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated
gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this
narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint
just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination

CHAPTER III.,charles
"RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN A SINECURE


For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and
solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of
the board.",charles
"It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,
that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the
prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have
established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once and for
ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the
wall, and attaching himself to the other.",charles
"To the performance of this
feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that
pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for
all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the
express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and
pronounced under their hands and seals.",charles
"There was a still greater
obstacle in Oliver’s youth and childishness.",charles
"He only cried bitterly all
day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands
before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner,
tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and
drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its
cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which
surrounded him.",charles
"Let it not be supposed by the enemies of “the system,” that, during the
period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of
exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious
consolation.",charles
"As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was
allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a
stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching
cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated
applications of the cane.",charles
"As for society, he was carried every other
day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a
public warning and example.",charles
"﻿THE YOUNG COUPLE


THERE is to be a wedding this morning at the corner house in the terrace.",charles
"The pastry-cook’s people have been there half-a-dozen times already; all
day yesterday there was a great stir and bustle, and they were up this
morning as soon as it was light.",charles
"Miss Emma Fielding is going to be
married to young Mr. Harvey.",charles
"Heaven alone can tell in what bright colours this marriage is painted
upon the mind of the little housemaid at number six, who has hardly slept
a wink all night with thinking of it, and now stands on the unswept
door-steps leaning upon her broom, and looking wistfully towards the
enchanted house.",charles
"Nothing short of omniscience can divine what visions of
the baker, or the green-grocer, or the smart and most insinuating
butterman, are flitting across her mind—what thoughts of how she would
dress on such an occasion, if she were a lady—of how she would dress, if
she were only a bride—of how cook would dress, being bridesmaid,
conjointly with her sister ‘in place’ at Fulham, and how the clergyman,
deeming them so many ladies, would be quite humbled and respectful.",charles
"What
day-dreams of hope and happiness—of life being one perpetual holiday,
with no master and no mistress to grant or withhold it—of every Sunday
being a Sunday out—of pure freedom as to curls and ringlets, and no
obligation to hide fine heads of hair in caps—what pictures of happiness,
vast and immense to her, but utterly ridiculous to us, bewilder the brain
of the little housemaid at number six, all called into existence by the
wedding at the corner!",charles
"We smile at such things, and so we should, though perhaps for a better
reason than commonly presents itself.",charles
"It should be pleasant to us to
know that there are notions of happiness so moderate and limited, since
upon those who entertain them, happiness and lightness of heart are very
easily bestowed.",charles
"But the little housemaid is awakened from her reverie, for forth from the
door of the magical corner house there runs towards her, all fluttering
in smart new dress and streaming ribands, her friend Jane Adams, who
comes all out of breath to redeem a solemn promise of taking her in,
under cover of the confusion, to see the breakfast table spread forth in
state, and—sight of sights!—her young mistress ready dressed for church.",charles
"And there, in good truth, when they have stolen up-stairs on tip-toe and
edged themselves in at the chamber-door—there is Miss Emma ‘looking like
the sweetest picter,’ in a white chip bonnet and orange flowers, and all
other elegancies becoming a bride, (with the make, shape, and quality of
every article of which the girl is perfectly familiar in one moment, and
never forgets to her dying day)—and there is Miss Emma’s mamma in tears,
and Miss Emma’s papa comforting her, and saying how that of course she
has been long looking forward to this, and how happy she ought to be—and
there too is Miss Emma’s sister with her arms round her neck, and the
other bridesmaid all smiles and tears, quieting the children, who would
cry more but that they are so finely dressed, and yet sob for fear sister
Emma should be taken away—and it is all so affecting, that the two
servant-girls cry more than anybody; and Jane Adams, sitting down upon
the stairs, when they have crept away, declares that her legs tremble so
that she don’t know what to do, and that she will say for Miss Emma, that
she never had a hasty word from her, and that she does hope and pray she
may be happy.",charles
"But Jane soon comes round again, and then surely there never was anything
like the breakfast table, glittering with plate and china, and set out
with flowers and sweets, and long-necked bottles, in the most sumptuous
and dazzling manner.",charles
"In the centre, too, is the mighty charm, the cake,
glistening with frosted sugar, and garnished beautifully.",charles
"They agree
that there ought to be a little Cupid under one of the barley-sugar
temples, or at least two hearts and an arrow; but, with this exception,
there is nothing to wish for, and a table could not be handsomer.",charles
"As
they arrive at this conclusion, who should come in but Mr. John!",charles
"to whom
Jane says that its only Anne from number six; and John says _he_ knows,
for he’s often winked his eye down the area, which causes Anne to blush
and look confused.",charles
"She is going away, indeed; when Mr. John will have it
that she must drink a glass of wine, and he says never mind it’s being
early in the morning, it won’t hurt her: so they shut the door and pour
out the wine; and Anne drinking lane’s health, and adding, ‘and here’s
wishing you yours, Mr. John,’ drinks it in a great many sips,—Mr.",charles
"John
all the time making jokes appropriate to the occasion.",charles
"At last Mr. John,
who has waxed bolder by degrees, pleads the usage at weddings, and claims
the privilege of a kiss, which he obtains after a great scuffle; and
footsteps being now heard on the stairs, they disperse suddenly.",charles
"By this time a carriage has driven up to convey the bride to church, and
Anne of number six prolonging the process of ‘cleaning her door,’ has the
satisfaction of beholding the bride and bridesmaids, and the papa and
mamma, hurry into the same and drive rapidly off.",charles
"Nor is this all, for
soon other carriages begin to arrive with a posse of company all
beautifully dressed, at whom she could stand and gaze for ever; but
having something else to do, is compelled to take one last long look and
shut the street-door.",charles
"And now the company have gone down to breakfast, and tears have given
place to smiles, for all the corks are out of the long-necked bottles,
and their contents are disappearing rapidly.",charles
"Miss Emma’s papa is at the
top of the table; Miss Emma’s mamma at the bottom; and beside the latter
are Miss Emma herself and her husband,—admitted on all hands to be the
handsomest and most interesting young couple ever known.",charles
"All down both
sides of the table, too, are various young ladies, beautiful to see, and
various young gentlemen who seem to think so; and there, in a post of
honour, is an unmarried aunt of Miss Emma’s, reported to possess
unheard-of riches, and to have expressed vast testamentary intentions
respecting her favourite niece and new nephew.",charles
"This lady has been very
liberal and generous already, as the jewels worn by the bride abundantly
testify, but that is nothing to what she means to do, or even to what she
has done, for she put herself in close communication with the dressmaker
three months ago, and prepared a wardrobe (with some articles worked by
her own hands) fit for a Princess.",charles
"People may call her an old maid, and
so she may be, but she is neither cross nor ugly for all that; on the
contrary, she is very cheerful and pleasant-looking, and very kind and
tender-hearted: which is no matter of surprise except to those who yield
to popular prejudices without thinking why, and will never grow wiser and
never know better.",charles
"Of all the company though, none are more pleasant to behold or better
pleased with themselves than two young children, who, in honour of the
day, have seats among the guests.",charles
"Of these, one is a little fellow of
six or eight years old, brother to the bride,—and the other a girl of the
same age, or something younger, whom he calls ‘his wife.’  The real bride
and bridegroom are not more devoted than they: he all love and attention,
and she all blushes and fondness, toying with a little bouquet which he
gave her this morning, and placing the scattered rose-leaves in her bosom
with nature’s own coquettishness.",charles
"They have dreamt of each other in
their quiet dreams, these children, and their little hearts have been
nearly broken when the absent one has been dispraised in jest.",charles
"When will
there come in after-life a passion so earnest, generous, and true as
theirs; what, even in its gentlest realities, can have the grace and
charm that hover round such fairy lovers!",charles
"By this time the merriment and happiness of the feast have gained their
height; certain ominous looks begin to be exchanged between the
bridesmaids, and somehow it gets whispered about that the carriage which
is to take the young couple into the country has arrived.",charles
"Such members
of the party as are most disposed to prolong its enjoyments, affect to
consider this a false alarm, but it turns out too true, being speedily
confirmed, first by the retirement of the bride and a select file of
intimates who are to prepare her for the journey, and secondly by the
withdrawal of the ladies generally.",charles
"To this there ensues a particularly
awkward pause, in which everybody essays to be facetious, and nobody
succeeds; at length the bridegroom makes a mysterious disappearance in
obedience to some equally mysterious signal; and the table is deserted.",charles
"Now, for at least six weeks last past it has been solemnly devised and
settled that the young couple should go away in secret; but they no
sooner appear without the door than the drawing-room windows are blocked
up with ladies waving their handkerchiefs and kissing their hands, and
the dining-room panes with gentlemen’s faces beaming farewell in every
queer variety of its expression.",charles
"The hall and steps are crowded with
servants in white favours, mixed up with particular friends and relations
who have darted out to say good-bye; and foremost in the group are the
tiny lovers arm in arm, thinking, with fluttering hearts, what happiness
it would be to dash away together in that gallant coach, and never part
again.",charles
"The bride has barely time for one hurried glance at her old home, when
the steps rattle, the door slams, the horses clatter on the pavement, and
they have left it far away.",charles
"A knot of women servants still remain clustered in the hall, whispering
among themselves, and there of course is Anne from number six, who has
made another escape on some plea or other, and been an admiring witness
of the departure.",charles
"There are two points on which Anne expatiates over and
over again, without the smallest appearance of fatigue or intending to
leave off; one is, that she ‘never see in all her life such a—oh such a
angel of a gentleman as Mr. Harvey’—and the other, that she ‘can’t tell
how it is, but it don’t seem a bit like a work-a-day, or a Sunday
neither—it’s all so unsettled and unregular.’

                 [Picture: Departure of the Young Couple]




THE FORMAL COUPLE


THE formal couple are the most prim, cold, immovable, and unsatisfactory
people on the face of the earth.",charles
"Their faces, voices, dress, house,
furniture, walk, and manner, are all the essence of formality, unrelieved
by one redeeming touch of frankness, heartiness, or nature.",charles
Everything with the formal couple resolves itself into a matter of form.,charles
"They don’t call upon you on your account, but their own; not to see how
you are, but to show how they are: it is not a ceremony to do honour to
you, but to themselves,—not due to your position, but to theirs.",charles
"If one
of a friend’s children die, the formal couple are as sure and punctual in
sending to the house as the undertaker; if a friend’s family be
increased, the monthly nurse is not more attentive than they.",charles
"The formal
couple, in fact, joyfully seize all occasions of testifying their
good-breeding and precise observance of the little usages of society; and
for you, who are the means to this end, they care as much as a man does
for the tailor who has enabled him to cut a figure, or a woman for the
milliner who has assisted her to a conquest.",charles
"Having an extensive connexion among that kind of people who make
acquaintances and eschew friends, the formal gentleman attends from time
to time a great many funerals, to which he is formally invited, and to
which he formally goes, as returning a call for the last time.",charles
"Here his
deportment is of the most faultless description; he knows the exact pitch
of voice it is proper to assume, the sombre look he ought to wear, the
melancholy tread which should be his gait for the day.",charles
"He is perfectly
acquainted with all the dreary courtesies to be observed in a
mourning-coach; knows when to sigh, and when to hide his nose in the
white handkerchief; and looks into the grave and shakes his head when the
ceremony is concluded, with the sad formality of a mute.",charles
"‘What kind of funeral was it?’ says the formal lady, when he returns
home.",charles
"‘Oh!’ replies the formal gentleman, ‘there never was such a gross
and disgusting impropriety; there were no feathers.’  ‘No feathers!’
cries the lady, as if on wings of black feathers dead people fly to
Heaven, and, lacking them, they must of necessity go elsewhere.",charles
"Her
husband shakes his head; and further adds, that they had seed-cake
instead of plum-cake, and that it was all white wine.",charles
"‘All white wine!’
exclaims his wife.",charles
"‘Nothing but sherry and madeira,’ says the husband.",charles
‘What!,charles
"no port?’  ‘Not a drop.’  No port, no plums, and no feathers!",charles
"‘You will recollect, my dear,’ says the formal lady, in a voice of
stately reproof, ‘that when we first met this poor man who is now dead
and gone, and he took that very strange course of addressing me at dinner
without being previously introduced, I ventured to express my opinion
that the family were quite ignorant of etiquette, and very imperfectly
acquainted with the decencies of life.",charles
"You have now had a good
opportunity of judging for yourself, and all I have to say is, that I
trust you will never go to a funeral _there_ again.’  ‘My dear,’ replies
the formal gentleman, ‘I never will.’  So the informal deceased is cut in
his grave; and the formal couple, when they tell the story of the
funeral, shake their heads, and wonder what some people’s feelings _are_
made of, and what their notions of propriety _can_ be!",charles
"If the formal couple have a family (which they sometimes have), they are
not children, but little, pale, sour, sharp-nosed men and women; and so
exquisitely brought up, that they might be very old dwarfs for anything
that appeareth to the contrary.",charles
"Indeed, they are so acquainted with
forms and conventionalities, and conduct themselves with such strict
decorum, that to see the little girl break a looking-glass in some wild
outbreak, or the little boy kick his parents, would be to any visitor an
unspeakable relief and consolation.",charles
"The formal couple are always sticklers for what is rigidly proper, and
have a great readiness in detecting hidden impropriety of speech or
thought, which by less scrupulous people would be wholly unsuspected.",charles
"Thus, if they pay a visit to the theatre, they sit all night in a perfect
agony lest anything improper or immoral should proceed from the stage;
and if anything should happen to be said which admits of a double
construction, they never fail to take it up directly, and to express by
their looks the great outrage which their feelings have sustained.",charles
"Perhaps this is their chief reason for absenting themselves almost
entirely from places of public amusement.",charles
"They go sometimes to the
Exhibition of the Royal Academy;—but that is often more shocking than the
stage itself, and the formal lady thinks that it really is high time Mr.
Etty was prosecuted and made a public example of.",charles
"We made one at a christening party not long since, where there were
amongst the guests a formal couple, who suffered the acutest torture from
certain jokes, incidental to such an occasion, cut—and very likely dried
also—by one of the godfathers; a red-faced elderly gentleman, who, being
highly popular with the rest of the company, had it all his own way, and
was in great spirits.",charles
"It was at supper-time that this gentleman came out
in full force.",charles
"We—being of a grave and quiet demeanour—had been chosen
to escort the formal lady down-stairs, and, sitting beside her, had a
favourable opportunity of observing her emotions.",charles
"We have a shrewd suspicion that, in the very beginning, and in the first
blush—literally the first blush—of the matter, the formal lady had not
felt quite certain whether the being present at such a ceremony, and
encouraging, as it were, the public exhibition of a baby, was not an act
involving some degree of indelicacy and impropriety; but certain we are
that when that baby’s health was drunk, and allusions were made, by a
grey-headed gentleman proposing it, to the time when he had dandled in
his arms the young Christian’s mother,—certain we are that then the
formal lady took the alarm, and recoiled from the old gentleman as from a
hoary profligate.",charles
"Still she bore it; she fanned herself with an
indignant air, but still she bore it.",charles
"A comic song was sung, involving a
confession from some imaginary gentleman that he had kissed a female, and
yet the formal lady bore it.",charles
"But when at last, the health of the
godfather before-mentioned being drunk, the godfather rose to return
thanks, and in the course of his observations darkly hinted at babies yet
unborn, and even contemplated the possibility of the subject of that
festival having brothers and sisters, the formal lady could endure no
more, but, bowing slightly round, and sweeping haughtily past the
offender, left the room in tears, under the protection of the formal
gentleman.",charles
"THE LOVING COUPLE


THERE cannot be a better practical illustration of the wise saw and
ancient instance, that there may be too much of a good thing, than is
presented by a loving couple.",charles
"Undoubtedly it is meet and proper that two
persons joined together in holy matrimony should be loving, and
unquestionably it is pleasant to know and see that they are so; but there
is a time for all things, and the couple who happen to be always in a
loving state before company, are well-nigh intolerable.",charles
"And in taking up this position we would have it distinctly understood
that we do not seek alone the sympathy of bachelors, in whose objection
to loving couples we recognise interested motives and personal
considerations.",charles
"We grant that to that unfortunate class of society there
may be something very irritating, tantalising, and provoking, in being
compelled to witness those gentle endearments and chaste interchanges
which to loving couples are quite the ordinary business of life.",charles
"But
while we recognise the natural character of the prejudice to which these
unhappy men are subject, we can neither receive their biassed evidence,
nor address ourself to their inflamed and angered minds.",charles
"Dispassionate
experience is our only guide; and in these moral essays we seek no less
to reform hymeneal offenders than to hold out a timely warning to all
rising couples, and even to those who have not yet set forth upon their
pilgrimage towards the matrimonial market.",charles
"Let all couples, present or to come, therefore profit by the example of
Mr. and Mrs. Leaver, themselves a loving couple in the first degree.",charles
"[Picture: The Loving Couple]

Mr. and Mrs. Leaver are pronounced by Mrs. Starling, a widow lady who
lost her husband when she was young, and lost herself about the
same-time—for by her own count she has never since grown five years
older—to be a perfect model of wedded felicity.",charles
"‘You would suppose,’
says the romantic lady, ‘that they were lovers only just now engaged.",charles
Never was such happiness!,charles
"They are so tender, so affectionate, so
attached to each other, so enamoured, that positively nothing can be more
charming!’

‘Augusta, my soul,’ says Mr. Leaver.",charles
"‘Augustus, my life,’ replies Mrs.
Leaver.",charles
"‘Sing some little ballad, darling,’ quoth Mr. Leaver.",charles
"‘I
couldn’t, indeed, dearest,’ returns Mrs. Leaver.",charles
"‘Do, my dove,’ says Mr.
Leaver.",charles
"‘I couldn’t possibly, my love,’ replies Mrs. Leaver; ‘and it’s
very naughty of you to ask me.’  ‘Naughty, darling!’ cries Mr. Leaver.",charles
"‘Yes, very naughty, and very cruel,’ returns Mrs. Leaver, ‘for you know I
have a sore throat, and that to sing would give me great pain.",charles
"You’re a
monster, and I hate you.",charles
"Go away!’  Mrs. Leaver has said ‘go away,’
because Mr. Leaver has tapped her under the chin: Mr. Leaver not doing as
he is bid, but on the contrary, sitting down beside her, Mrs. Leaver
slaps Mr. Leaver; and Mr. Leaver in return slaps Mrs. Leaver, and it
being now time for all persons present to look the other way, they look
the other way, and hear a still small sound as of kissing, at which Mrs.
Starling is thoroughly enraptured, and whispers her neighbour that if all
married couples were like that, what a heaven this earth would be!",charles
"The loving couple are at home when this occurs, and maybe only three or
four friends are present, but, unaccustomed to reserve upon this
interesting point, they are pretty much the same abroad.",charles
"Indeed upon
some occasions, such as a pic-nic or a water-party, their lovingness is
even more developed, as we had an opportunity last summer of observing in
person.",charles
"There was a great water-party made up to go to Twickenham and dine, and
afterwards dance in an empty villa by the river-side, hired expressly for
the purpose.",charles
"Mr. and Mrs. Leaver were of the company; and it was our
fortune to have a seat in the same boat, which was an eight-oared galley,
manned by amateurs, with a blue striped awning of the same pattern as
their Guernsey shirts, and a dingy red flag of the same shade as the
whiskers of the stroke oar.",charles
"A coxswain being appointed, and all other
matters adjusted, the eight gentlemen threw themselves into strong
paroxysms, and pulled up with the tide, stimulated by the compassionate
remarks of the ladies, who one and all exclaimed, that it seemed an
immense exertion—as indeed it did.",charles
"At first we raced the other boat,
which came alongside in gallant style; but this being found an unpleasant
amusement, as giving rise to a great quantity of splashing, and rendering
the cold pies and other viands very moist, it was unanimously voted down,
and we were suffered to shoot a-head, while the second boat followed
ingloriously in our wake.",charles
It was at this time that we first recognised Mr. Leaver.,charles
"There were two
firemen-watermen in the boat, lying by until somebody was exhausted; and
one of them, who had taken upon himself the direction of affairs, was
heard to cry in a gruff voice, ‘Pull away, number two—give it her, number
two—take a longer reach, number two—now, number two, sir, think you’re
winning a boat.’  The greater part of the company had no doubt begun to
wonder which of the striped Guernseys it might be that stood in need of
such encouragement, when a stifled shriek from Mrs. Leaver confirmed the
doubtful and informed the ignorant; and Mr. Leaver, still further
disguised in a straw hat and no neckcloth, was observed to be in a
fearful perspiration, and failing visibly.",charles
"Nor was the general
consternation diminished at this instant by the same gentleman (in the
performance of an accidental aquatic feat, termed ‘catching a crab’)
plunging suddenly backward, and displaying nothing of himself to the
company, but two violently struggling legs.",charles
"Mrs. Leaver shrieked again
several times, and cried piteously—‘Is he dead?",charles
Tell me the worst.,charles
"Is
he dead?’

Now, a moment’s reflection might have convinced the loving wife, that
unless her husband were endowed with some most surprising powers of
muscular action, he never could be dead while he kicked so hard; but
still Mrs. Leaver cried, ‘Is he dead?",charles
"is he dead?’ and still everybody
else cried—‘No, no, no,’ until such time as Mr. Leaver was replaced in a
sitting posture, and his oar (which had been going through all kinds of
wrong-headed performances on its own account) was once more put in his
hand, by the exertions of the two firemen-watermen.",charles
"Mr. Leaver then
exclaimed, ‘Augustus, my child, come to me;’ and Mr. Leaver said,
‘Augusta, my love, compose yourself, I am not injured.’  But Mrs. Leaver
cried again more piteously than before, ‘Augustus, my child, come to me;’
and now the company generally, who seemed to be apprehensive that if Mr.
Leaver remained where he was, he might contribute more than his proper
share towards the drowning of the party, disinterestedly took part with
Mrs. Leaver, and said he really ought to go, and that he was not strong
enough for such violent exercise, and ought never to have undertaken it.",charles
"Reluctantly, Mr. Leaver went, and laid himself down at Mrs. Leaver’s
feet, and Mrs. Leaver stooping over him, said, ‘Oh Augustus, how could
you terrify me so?’ and Mr. Leaver said, ‘Augusta, my sweet, I never
meant to terrify you;’ and Mrs. Leaver said, ‘You are faint, my dear;’
and Mr. Leaver said, ‘I am rather so, my love;’ and they were very loving
indeed under Mrs. Leaver’s veil, until at length Mr. Leaver came forth
again, and pleasantly asked if he had not heard something said about
bottled stout and sandwiches.",charles
"Mrs. Starling, who was one of the party, was perfectly delighted with
this scene, and frequently murmured half-aside, ‘What a loving couple you
are!’ or ‘How delightful it is to see man and wife so happy together!’
To us she was quite poetical, (for we are a kind of cousins,) observing
that hearts beating in unison like that made life a paradise of sweets;
and that when kindred creatures were drawn together by sympathies so fine
and delicate, what more than mortal happiness did not our souls partake!",charles
"To all this we answered ‘Certainly,’ or ‘Very true,’ or merely sighed, as
the case might be.",charles
"At every new act of the loving couple, the widow’s
admiration broke out afresh; and when Mrs. Leaver would not permit Mr.
Leaver to keep his hat off, lest the sun should strike to his head, and
give him a brain fever, Mrs. Starling actually shed tears, and said it
reminded her of Adam and Eve.",charles
"The loving couple were thus loving all the way to Twickenham, but when we
arrived there (by which time the amateur crew looked very thirsty and
vicious) they were more playful than ever, for Mrs. Leaver threw stones
at Mr. Leaver, and Mr. Leaver ran after Mrs. Leaver on the grass, in a
most innocent and enchanting manner.",charles
"At dinner, too, Mr. Leaver _would_
steal Mrs. Leaver’s tongue, and Mrs. Leaver _would_ retaliate upon Mr.
Leaver’s fowl; and when Mrs. Leaver was going to take some lobster salad,
Mr. Leaver wouldn’t let her have any, saying that it made her ill, and
she was always sorry for it afterwards, which afforded Mrs. Leaver an
opportunity of pretending to be cross, and showing many other
prettinesses.",charles
"But this was merely the smiling surface of their loves,
not the mighty depths of the stream, down to which the company, to say
the truth, dived rather unexpectedly, from the following accident.",charles
"It
chanced that Mr. Leaver took upon himself to propose the bachelors who
had first originated the notion of that entertainment, in doing which, he
affected to regret that he was no longer of their body himself, and
pretended grievously to lament his fallen state.",charles
"This Mrs. Leaver’s
feelings could not brook, even in jest, and consequently, exclaiming
aloud, ‘He loves me not, he loves me not!’ she fell in a very pitiable
state into the arms of Mrs. Starling, and, directly becoming insensible,
was conveyed by that lady and her husband into another room.",charles
"Presently
Mr. Leaver came running back to know if there was a medical gentleman in
company, and as there was, (in what company is there not?)",charles
"both Mr.
Leaver and the medical gentleman hurried away together.",charles
"The medical gentleman was the first who returned, and among his intimate
friends he was observed to laugh and wink, and look as unmedical as might
be; but when Mr. Leaver came back he was very solemn, and in answer to
all inquiries, shook his head, and remarked that Augusta was far too
sensitive to be trifled with—an opinion which the widow subsequently
confirmed.",charles
"Finding that she was in no imminent peril, however, the rest
of the party betook themselves to dancing on the green, and very merry
and happy they were, and a vast quantity of flirtation there was; the
last circumstance being no doubt attributable, partly to the fineness of
the weather, and partly to the locality, which is well known to be
favourable to all harmless recreations.",charles
"In the bustle of the scene, Mr. and Mrs. Leaver stole down to the boat,
and disposed themselves under the awning, Mrs. Leaver reclining her head
upon Mr. Leaver’s shoulder, and Mr. Leaver grasping her hand with great
fervour, and looking in her face from time to time with a melancholy and
sympathetic aspect.",charles
"The widow sat apart, feigning to be occupied with a
book, but stealthily observing them from behind her fan; and the two
firemen-watermen, smoking their pipes on the bank hard by, nudged each
other, and grinned in enjoyment of the joke.",charles
"Very few of the party
missed the loving couple; and the few who did, heartily congratulated
each other on their disappearance.",charles
"THE CONTRADICTORY COUPLE


ONE would suppose that two people who are to pass their whole lives
together, and must necessarily be very often alone with each other, could
find little pleasure in mutual contradiction; and yet what is more common
than a contradictory couple?",charles
The contradictory couple agree in nothing but contradiction.,charles
"They return
home from Mrs. Bluebottle’s dinner-party, each in an opposite corner of
the coach, and do not exchange a syllable until they have been seated for
at least twenty minutes by the fireside at home, when the gentleman,
raising his eyes from the stove, all at once breaks silence:

‘What a very extraordinary thing it is,’ says he, ‘that you _will_
contradict, Charlotte!’  ‘_I_ contradict!’ cries the lady, ‘but that’s
just like you.’  ‘What’s like me?’ says the gentleman sharply.",charles
"‘Saying
that I contradict you,’ replies the lady.",charles
"‘Do you mean to say that you
do _not_ contradict me?’ retorts the gentleman; ‘do you mean to say that
you have not been contradicting me the whole of this day?’  ‘Do you mean
to tell me now, that you have not?",charles
"I mean to tell you nothing of the
kind,’ replies the lady quietly; ‘when you are wrong, of course I shall
contradict you.’

During this dialogue the gentleman has been taking his brandy-and-water
on one side of the fire, and the lady, with her dressing-case on the
table, has been curling her hair on the other.",charles
"She now lets down her
back hair, and proceeds to brush it; preserving at the same time an air
of conscious rectitude and suffering virtue, which is intended to
exasperate the gentleman—and does so.",charles
"‘I do believe,’ he says, taking the spoon out of his glass, and tossing
it on the table, ‘that of all the obstinate, positive, wrong-headed
creatures that were ever born, you are the most so, Charlotte.’
‘Certainly, certainly, have it your own way, pray.",charles
"You see how much _I_
contradict you,’ rejoins the lady.",charles
"‘Of course, you didn’t contradict me
at dinner-time—oh no, not you!’ says the gentleman.",charles
"‘Yes, I did,’ says
the lady.",charles
"‘Oh, you did,’ cries the gentleman ‘you admit that?’  ‘If you
call that contradiction, I do,’ the lady answers; ‘and I say again,
Edward, that when I know you are wrong, I will contradict you.",charles
"I am not
your slave.’  ‘Not my slave!’ repeats the gentleman bitterly; ‘and you
still mean to say that in the Blackburns’ new house there are not more
than fourteen doors, including the door of the wine-cellar!’  ‘I mean to
say,’ retorts the lady, beating time with her hair-brush on the palm of
her hand, ‘that in that house there are fourteen doors and no more.’
‘Well then—’ cries the gentleman, rising in despair, and pacing the room
with rapid strides.",charles
"‘By G-, this is enough to destroy a man’s intellect,
and drive him mad!’

By and by the gentleman comes-to a little, and passing his hand gloomily
across his forehead, reseats himself in his former chair.",charles
"There is a
long silence, and this time the lady begins.",charles
"‘I appealed to Mr. Jenkins,
who sat next to me on the sofa in the drawing-room during tea—’  ‘Morgan,
you mean,’ interrupts the gentleman.",charles
"‘I do not mean anything of the
kind,’ answers the lady.",charles
"‘Now, by all that is aggravating and impossible
to bear,’ cries the gentleman, clenching his hands and looking upwards in
agony, ‘she is going to insist upon it that Morgan is Jenkins!’  ‘Do you
take me for a perfect fool?’ exclaims the lady; ‘do you suppose I don’t
know the one from the other?",charles
"Do you suppose I don’t know that the man in
the blue coat was Mr. Jenkins?’  ‘Jenkins in a blue coat!’ cries the
gentleman with a groan; ‘Jenkins in a blue coat!",charles
"a man who would suffer
death rather than wear anything but brown!’  ‘Do you dare to charge me
with telling an untruth?’ demands the lady, bursting into tears.",charles
"‘I
charge you, ma’am,’ retorts the gentleman, starting up, ‘with being a
monster of contradiction, a monster of aggravation, a—a—a—Jenkins in a
blue coat!—what have I done that I should be doomed to hear such
statements!’

Expressing himself with great scorn and anguish, the gentleman takes up
his candle and stalks off to bed, where feigning to be fast asleep when
the lady comes up-stairs drowned in tears, murmuring lamentations over
her hard fate and indistinct intentions of consulting her brothers, he
undergoes the secret torture of hearing her exclaim between whiles, ‘I
know there are only fourteen doors in the house, I know it was Mr.
Jenkins, I know he had a blue coat on, and I would say it as positively
as I do now, if they were the last words I had to speak!’

If the contradictory couple are blessed with children, they are not the
less contradictory on that account.",charles
"Master James and Miss Charlotte
present themselves after dinner, and being in perfect good humour, and
finding their parents in the same amiable state, augur from these
appearances half a glass of wine a-piece and other extraordinary
indulgences.",charles
"But unfortunately Master James, growing talkative upon such
prospects, asks his mamma how tall Mrs. Parsons is, and whether she is
not six feet high; to which his mamma replies, ‘Yes, she should think she
was, for Mrs. Parsons is a very tall lady indeed; quite a giantess.’
‘For Heaven’s sake, Charlotte,’ cries her husband, ‘do not tell the child
such preposterous nonsense.",charles
"Six feet high!’  ‘Well,’ replies the lady,
‘surely I may be permitted to have an opinion; my opinion is, that she is
six feet high—at least six feet.’  ‘Now you know, Charlotte,’ retorts the
gentleman sternly, ‘that that is _not_ your opinion—that you have no such
idea—and that you only say this for the sake of contradiction.’  ‘You are
exceedingly polite,’ his wife replies; ‘to be wrong about such a paltry
question as anybody’s height, would be no great crime; but I say again,
that I believe Mrs. Parsons to be six feet—more than six feet; nay, I
believe you know her to be full six feet, and only say she is not,
because I say she is.’  This taunt disposes the gentleman to become
violent, but he cheeks himself, and is content to mutter, in a haughty
tone, ‘Six feet—ha!",charles
ha!,charles
"Mrs. Parsons six feet!’ and the lady answers,
‘Yes, six feet.",charles
"I am sure I am glad you are amused, and I’ll say it
again—six feet.’  Thus the subject gradually drops off, and the
contradiction begins to be forgotten, when Master James, with some
undefined notion of making himself agreeable, and putting things to
rights again, unfortunately asks his mamma what the moon’s made of; which
gives her occasion to say that he had better not ask her, for she is
always wrong and never can be right; that he only exposes her to
contradiction by asking any question of her; and that he had better ask
his papa, who is infallible, and never can be wrong.",charles
"Papa, smarting
under this attack, gives a terrible pull at the bell, and says, that if
the conversation is to proceed in this way, the children had better be
removed.",charles
"Removed they are, after a few tears and many struggles; and Pa
having looked at Ma sideways for a minute or two, with a baleful eye,
draws his pocket-handkerchief over his face, and composes himself for his
after-dinner nap.",charles
"The friends of the contradictory couple often deplore their frequent
disputes, though they rather make light of them at the same time:
observing, that there is no doubt they are very much attached to each
other, and that they never quarrel except about trifles.",charles
"But neither the
friends of the contradictory couple, nor the contradictory couple
themselves, reflect, that as the most stupendous objects in nature are
but vast collections of minute particles, so the slightest and least
considered trifles make up the sum of human happiness or misery.",charles
"THE COUPLE WHO DOTE UPON THEIR CHILDREN


THE couple who dote upon their children have usually a great many of
them: six or eight at least.",charles
"The children are either the healthiest in
all the world, or the most unfortunate in existence.",charles
"In either case,
they are equally the theme of their doting parents, and equally a source
of mental anguish and irritation to their doting parents’ friends.",charles
"The couple who dote upon their children recognise no dates but those
connected with their births, accidents, illnesses, or remarkable deeds.",charles
"They keep a mental almanack with a vast number of Innocents’-days, all in
red letters.",charles
"They recollect the last coronation, because on that day
little Tom fell down the kitchen stairs; the anniversary of the Gunpowder
Plot, because it was on the fifth of November that Ned asked whether
wooden legs were made in heaven and cocked hats grew in gardens.",charles
"Mrs.
Whiffler will never cease to recollect the last day of the old year as
long as she lives, for it was on that day that the baby had the four red
spots on its nose which they took for measles: nor Christmas-day, for
twenty-one days after Christmas-day the twins were born; nor Good Friday,
for it was on a Good Friday that she was frightened by the donkey-cart
when she was in the family way with Georgiana.",charles
"The movable feasts have
no motion for Mr. and Mrs. Whiffler, but remain pinned down tight and
fast to the shoulders of some small child, from whom they can never be
separated any more.",charles
"Time was made, according to their creed, not for
slaves but for girls and boys; the restless sands in his glass are but
little children at play.",charles
"[Picture: The Couple who Dote upon their Children]

As we have already intimated, the children of this couple can know no
medium.",charles
"They are either prodigies of good health or prodigies of bad
health; whatever they are, they must be prodigies.",charles
"Mr. Whiffler must
have to describe at his office such excruciating agonies constantly
undergone by his eldest boy, as nobody else’s eldest boy ever underwent;
or he must be able to declare that there never was a child endowed with
such amazing health, such an indomitable constitution, and such a
cast-iron frame, as his child.",charles
"His children must be, in some respect or
other, above and beyond the children of all other people.",charles
"To such an
extent is this feeling pushed, that we were once slightly acquainted with
a lady and gentleman who carried their heads so high and became so proud
after their youngest child fell out of a two-pair-of-stairs window
without hurting himself much, that the greater part of their friends were
obliged to forego their acquaintance.",charles
"But perhaps this may be an extreme
case, and one not justly entitled to be considered as a precedent of
general application.",charles
"If a friend happen to dine in a friendly way with one of these couples
who dote upon their children, it is nearly impossible for him to divert
the conversation from their favourite topic.",charles
"Everything reminds Mr.
Whiffler of Ned, or Mrs. Whiffler of Mary Anne, or of the time before Ned
was born, or the time before Mary Anne was thought of.",charles
"The slightest
remark, however harmless in itself, will awaken slumbering recollections
of the twins.",charles
It is impossible to steer clear of them.,charles
"They will come
uppermost, let the poor man do what he may.",charles
"Ned has been known to be
lost sight of for half an hour, Dick has been forgotten, the name of Mary
Anne has not been mentioned, but the twins will out.",charles
"Nothing can keep
down the twins.",charles
"‘It’s a very extraordinary thing, Saunders,’ says Mr. Whiffler to the
visitor, ‘but—you have seen our little babies, the—the—twins?’  The
friend’s heart sinks within him as he answers, ‘Oh, yes—often.’  ‘Your
talking of the Pyramids,’ says Mr. Whiffler, quite as a matter of course,
‘reminds me of the twins.",charles
"It’s a very extraordinary thing about those
babies—what colour should you say their eyes were?’  ‘Upon my word,’ the
friend stammers, ‘I hardly know how to answer’—the fact being, that
except as the friend does not remember to have heard of any departure
from the ordinary course of nature in the instance of these twins, they
might have no eyes at all for aught he has observed to the contrary.",charles
"‘You wouldn’t say they were red, I suppose?’ says Mr. Whiffler.",charles
"The
friend hesitates, and rather thinks they are; but inferring from the
expression of Mr. Whiffler’s face that red is not the colour, smiles with
some confidence, and says, ‘No, no!",charles
"very different from that.’  ‘What
should you say to blue?’ says Mr. Whiffler.",charles
"The friend glances at him,
and observing a different expression in his face, ventures to say, ‘I
should say they _were_ blue—a decided blue.’  ‘To be sure!’ cries Mr.
Whiffler, triumphantly, ‘I knew you would!",charles
"But what should you say if I
was to tell you that the boy’s eyes are blue and the girl’s hazel, eh?’
‘Impossible!’ exclaims the friend, not at all knowing why it should be
impossible.",charles
"‘A fact, notwithstanding,’ cries Mr. Whiffler; ‘and let me
tell you, Saunders, _that’s_ not a common thing in twins, or a
circumstance that’ll happen every day.’

In this dialogue Mrs. Whiffler, as being deeply responsible for the
twins, their charms and singularities, has taken no share; but she now
relates, in broken English, a witticism of little Dick’s bearing upon the
subject just discussed, which delights Mr. Whiffler beyond measure, and
causes him to declare that he would have sworn that was Dick’s if he had
heard it anywhere.",charles
"Then he requests that Mrs. Whiffler will tell
Saunders what Tom said about mad bulls; and Mrs. Whiffler relating the
anecdote, a discussion ensues upon the different character of Tom’s wit
and Dick’s wit, from which it appears that Dick’s humour is of a lively
turn, while Tom’s style is the dry and caustic.",charles
"This discussion being
enlivened by various illustrations, lasts a long time, and is only
stopped by Mrs. Whiffler instructing the footman to ring the nursery
bell, as the children were promised that they should come down and taste
the pudding.",charles
"The friend turns pale when this order is given, and paler still when it
is followed up by a great pattering on the staircase, (not unlike the
sound of rain upon a skylight,) a violent bursting open of the
dining-room door, and the tumultuous appearance of six small children,
closely succeeded by a strong nursery-maid with a twin in each arm.",charles
"As
the whole eight are screaming, shouting, or kicking—some influenced by a
ravenous appetite, some by a horror of the stranger, and some by a
conflict of the two feelings—a pretty long space elapses before all their
heads can be ranged round the table and anything like order restored; in
bringing about which happy state of things both the nurse and footman are
severely scratched.",charles
"At length Mrs. Whiffler is heard to say, ‘Mr.",charles
"Saunders, shall I give you some pudding?’  A breathless silence ensues,
and sixteen small eyes are fixed upon the guest in expectation of his
reply.",charles
"A wild shout of joy proclaims that he has said ‘No, thank you.’
Spoons are waved in the air, legs appear above the table-cloth in
uncontrollable ecstasy, and eighty short fingers dabble in damson syrup.",charles
"While the pudding is being disposed of, Mr. and Mrs. Whiffler look on
with beaming countenances, and Mr. Whiffler nudging his friend Saunders,
begs him to take notice of Tom’s eyes, or Dick’s chin, or Ned’s nose, or
Mary Anne’s hair, or Emily’s figure, or little Bob’s calves, or Fanny’s
mouth, or Carry’s head, as the case may be.",charles
"Whatever the attention of
Mr. Saunders is called to, Mr. Saunders admires of course; though he is
rather confused about the sex of the youngest branches and looks at the
wrong children, turning to a girl when Mr. Whiffler directs his attention
to a boy, and falling into raptures with a boy when he ought to be
enchanted with a girl.",charles
"Then the dessert comes, and there is a vast deal
of scrambling after fruit, and sudden spirting forth of juice out of
tight oranges into infant eyes, and much screeching and wailing in
consequence.",charles
"At length it becomes time for Mrs. Whiffler to retire, and
all the children are by force of arms compelled to kiss and love Mr.
Saunders before going up-stairs, except Tom, who, lying on his back in
the hall, proclaims that Mr. Saunders ‘is a naughty beast;’ and Dick, who
having drunk his father’s wine when he was looking another way, is found
to be intoxicated and is carried out, very limp and helpless.",charles
"Mr. Whiffler and his friend are left alone together, but Mr. Whiffler’s
thoughts are still with his family, if his family are not with him.",charles
"‘Saunders,’ says he, after a short silence, ‘if you please, we’ll drink
Mrs. Whiffler and the children.’  Mr. Saunders feels this to be a
reproach against himself for not proposing the same sentiment, and drinks
it in some confusion.",charles
"‘Ah!’ Mr. Whiffler sighs, ‘these children,
Saunders, make one quite an old man.’  Mr. Saunders thinks that if they
were his, they would make him a very old man; but he says nothing.",charles
"‘And
yet,’ pursues Mr. Whiffler, ‘what can equal domestic happiness?",charles
"what can
equal the engaging ways of children!",charles
"Saunders, why don’t you get
married?’  Now, this is an embarrassing question, because Mr. Saunders
has been thinking that if he had at any time entertained matrimonial
designs, the revelation of that day would surely have routed them for
ever.",charles
"‘I am glad, however,’ says Mr. Whiffler, ‘that you _are_ a
bachelor,—glad on one account, Saunders; a selfish one, I admit.",charles
"Will
you do Mrs. Whiffler and myself a favour?’  Mr. Saunders is
surprised—evidently surprised; but he replies, ‘with the greatest
pleasure.’  ‘Then, will you, Saunders,’ says Mr. Whiffler, in an
impressive manner, ‘will you cement and consolidate our friendship by
coming into the family (so to speak) as a godfather?’  ‘I shall be proud
and delighted,’ replies Mr. Saunders: ‘which of the children is it?",charles
"really, I thought they were all christened; or—’  ‘Saunders,’ Mr.
Whiffler interposes, ‘they _are_ all christened; you are right.",charles
"The fact
is, that Mrs. Whiffler is—in short, we expect another.’  ‘Not a ninth!’
cries the friend, all aghast at the idea.",charles
"‘Yes, Saunders,’ rejoins Mr.
Whiffler, solemnly, ‘a ninth.",charles
Did we drink Mrs. Whiffler’s health?,charles
"﻿CHAPTER I--HIS LEAVING IT TILL CALLED FOR


The writer of these humble lines being a Waiter, and having come of a
family of Waiters, and owning at the present time five brothers who are
all Waiters, and likewise an only sister who is a Waitress, would wish to
offer a few words respecting his calling; first having the pleasure of
hereby in a friendly manner offering the Dedication of the same unto
_Joseph_, much respected Head Waiter at the Slamjam Coffee-house, London,
E.C., than which a individual more eminently deserving of the name of
man, or a more amenable honour to his own head and heart, whether
considered in the light of a Waiter or regarded as a human being, do not
exist.",charles
"In case confusion should arise in the public mind (which it is open to
confusion on many subjects) respecting what is meant or implied by the
term Waiter, the present humble lines would wish to offer an explanation.",charles
"It may not be generally known that the person as goes out to wait is
_not_ a Waiter.",charles
"It may not be generally known that the hand as is called
in extra, at the Freemasons' Tavern, or the London, or the Albion, or
otherwise, is _not_ a Waiter.",charles
"Such hands may be took on for Public
Dinners by the bushel (and you may know them by their breathing with
difficulty when in attendance, and taking away the bottle ere yet it is
half out); but such are _not_ Waiters.",charles
"For you cannot lay down the
tailoring, or the shoemaking, or the brokering, or the green-grocering,
or the pictorial-periodicalling, or the second-hand wardrobe, or the
small fancy businesses,--you cannot lay down those lines of life at your
will and pleasure by the half-day or evening, and take up Waitering.",charles
"You
may suppose you can, but you cannot; or you may go so far as to say you
do, but you do not.",charles
"Nor yet can you lay down the gentleman's-service
when stimulated by prolonged incompatibility on the part of Cooks (and
here it may be remarked that Cooking and Incompatibility will be mostly
found united), and take up Waitering.",charles
"It has been ascertained that what
a gentleman will sit meek under, at home, he will not bear out of doors,
at the Slamjam or any similar establishment.",charles
"Then, what is the inference
to be drawn respecting true Waitering?",charles
You must be bred to it.,charles
"You must
be born to it.",charles
"Would you know how born to it, Fair Reader,--if of the adorable female
sex?",charles
"Then learn from the biographical experience of one that is a Waiter
in the sixty-first year of his age.",charles
"You were conveyed,--ere yet your dawning powers were otherwise developed
than to harbour vacancy in your inside,--you were conveyed, by
surreptitious means, into a pantry adjoining the Admiral Nelson, Civic
and General Dining-Rooms, there to receive by stealth that healthful
sustenance which is the pride and boast of the British female
constitution.",charles
"Your mother was married to your father (himself a distant
Waiter) in the profoundest secrecy; for a Waitress known to be married
would ruin the best of businesses,--it is the same as on the stage.",charles
"Hence
your being smuggled into the pantry, and that--to add to the
infliction--by an unwilling grandmother.",charles
"Under the combined influence of
the smells of roast and boiled, and soup, and gas, and malt liquors, you
partook of your earliest nourishment; your unwilling grandmother sitting
prepared to catch you when your mother was called and dropped you; your
grandmother's shawl ever ready to stifle your natural complainings; your
innocent mind surrounded by uncongenial cruets, dirty plates,
dish-covers, and cold gravy; your mother calling down the pipe for veals
and porks, instead of soothing you with nursery rhymes.",charles
"Under these
untoward circumstances you were early weaned.",charles
"Your unwilling
grandmother, ever growing more unwilling as your food assimilated less,
then contracted habits of shaking you till your system curdled, and your
food would not assimilate at all.",charles
"At length she was no longer spared,
and could have been thankfully spared much sooner.",charles
"When your brothers
began to appear in succession, your mother retired, left off her smart
dressing (she had previously been a smart dresser), and her dark ringlets
(which had previously been flowing), and haunted your father late of
nights, lying in wait for him, through all weathers, up the shabby court
which led to the back door of the Royal Old Dust-Bin (said to have been
so named by George the Fourth), where your father was Head.",charles
"But the Dust-
Bin was going down then, and your father took but little,--excepting from
a liquid point of view.",charles
"Your mother's object in those visits was of a
house-keeping character, and you was set on to whistle your father out.",charles
"Sometimes he came out, but generally not.",charles
"Come or not come, however, all
that part of his existence which was unconnected with open Waitering was
kept a close secret, and was acknowledged by your mother to be a close
secret, and you and your mother flitted about the court, close secrets
both of you, and would scarcely have confessed under torture that you
know your father, or that your father had any name than Dick (which
wasn't his name, though he was never known by any other), or that he had
kith or kin or chick or child.",charles
"Perhaps the attraction of this mystery,
combined with your father's having a damp compartment, to himself, behind
a leaky cistern, at the Dust-Bin,--a sort of a cellar compartment, with a
sink in it, and a smell, and a plate-rack, and a bottle-rack, and three
windows that didn't match each other or anything else, and no
daylight,--caused your young mind to feel convinced that you must grow up
to be a Waiter too; but you did feel convinced of it, and so did all your
brothers, down to your sister.",charles
"Every one of you felt convinced that you
was born to the Waitering.",charles
"At this stage of your career, what was your
feelings one day when your father came home to your mother in open broad
daylight,--of itself an act of Madness on the part of a Waiter,--and took
to his bed (leastwise, your mother and family's bed), with the statement
that his eyes were devilled kidneys.",charles
"Physicians being in vain, your
father expired, after repeating at intervals for a day and a night, when
gleams of reason and old business fitfully illuminated his being, ""Two
and two is five.",charles
"And three is sixpence.""",charles
"Interred in the parochial
department of the neighbouring churchyard, and accompanied to the grave
by as many Waiters of long standing as could spare the morning time from
their soiled glasses (namely, one), your bereaved form was attired in a
white neckankecher, and you was took on from motives of benevolence at
The George and Gridiron, theatrical and supper.",charles
"Here, supporting nature
on what you found in the plates (which was as it happened, and but too
often thoughtlessly, immersed in mustard), and on what you found in the
glasses (which rarely went beyond driblets and lemon), by night you
dropped asleep standing, till you was cuffed awake, and by day was set to
polishing every individual article in the coffee-room.",charles
"Your couch being
sawdust; your counterpane being ashes of cigars.",charles
"Here, frequently hiding
a heavy heart under the smart tie of your white neckankecher (or
correctly speaking lower down and more to the left), you picked up the
rudiments of knowledge from an extra, by the name of Bishops, and by
calling plate-washer, and gradually elevating your mind with chalk on the
back of the corner-box partition, until such time as you used the
inkstand when it was out of hand, attained to manhood, and to be the
Waiter that you find yourself.",charles
"I could wish here to offer a few respectful words on behalf of the
calling so long the calling of myself and family, and the public interest
in which is but too often very limited.",charles
We are not generally understood.,charles
"No, we are not.",charles
Allowance enough is not made for us.,charles
"For, say that we
ever show a little drooping listlessness of spirits, or what might be
termed indifference or apathy.",charles
"Put it to yourself what would your own
state of mind be, if you was one of an enormous family every member of
which except you was always greedy, and in a hurry.",charles
"Put it to yourself
that you was regularly replete with animal food at the slack hours of one
in the day and again at nine p.m., and that the repleter you was, the
more voracious all your fellow-creatures came in.",charles
"Put it to yourself
that it was your business, when your digestion was well on, to take a
personal interest and sympathy in a hundred gentlemen fresh and fresh
(say, for the sake of argument, only a hundred), whose imaginations was
given up to grease and fat and gravy and melted butter, and abandoned to
questioning you about cuts of this, and dishes of that,--each of 'em
going on as if him and you and the bill of fare was alone in the world.",charles

acting as pall-bearers, all keeping step in a pouring shower without a
dry eye visible, and a concourse only inferior to Royalty, his pantry and
lodgings was equally ransacked high and low for property, and none was
found!",charles
"How could it be found, when, beyond his last monthly collection
of walking-sticks, umbrellas, and pocket-handkerchiefs (which happened to
have been not yet disposed of, though he had ever been through life
punctual in clearing off his collections by the month), there was no
property existing?",charles
"Such, however, is the force of this universal libel,
that the widow of Old Charles, at the present hour an inmate of the
Almshouses of the Cork-Cutters' Company, in Blue Anchor Road (identified
sitting at the door of one of 'em, in a clean cap and a Windsor
arm-chair, only last Monday), expects John's hoarded wealth to be found
hourly!",charles
"Nay, ere yet he had succumbed to the grisly dart, and when his
portrait was painted in oils life-size, by subscription of the
frequenters of the West Country, to hang over the coffee-room chimney-
piece, there were not wanting those who contended that what is termed the
accessories of such a portrait ought to be the Bank of England out of
window, and a strong-box on the table.",charles
"And but for better-regulated
minds contending for a bottle and screw and the attitude of drawing,--and
carrying their point,--it would have been so handed down to posterity.",charles
I am now brought to the title of the present remarks.,charles
"Having, I hope
without offence to any quarter, offered such observations as I felt it my
duty to offer, in a free country which has ever dominated the seas, on
the general subject, I will now proceed to wait on the particular
question.",charles
"At a momentous period of my life, when I was off, so far as concerned
notice given, with a House that shall be nameless,--for the question on
which I took my departing stand was a fixed charge for waiters, and no
House as commits itself to that eminently Un-English act of more than
foolishness and baseness shall be advertised by me,--I repeat, at a
momentous crisis, when I was off with a House too mean for mention, and
not yet on with that to which I have ever since had the honour of being
attached in the capacity of Head, {1} I was casting about what to do
next.",charles
"Then it were that proposals were made to me on behalf of my
present establishment.",charles
"Stipulations were necessary on my part,
emendations were necessary on my part: in the end, ratifications ensued
on both sides, and I entered on a new career.",charles
"We are a bed business, and a coffee-room business.",charles
"We are not a general
dining business, nor do we wish it.",charles
"In consequence, when diners drop in,
we know what to give 'em as will keep 'em away another time.",charles
"We are a
Private Room or Family business also; but Coffee-room principal.",charles
"Me and
the Directory and the Writing Materials and cetrer occupy a place to
ourselves--a place fended of up a step or two at the end of the Coffee-
room, in what I call the good old-fashioned style.",charles
"The good
old-fashioned style is, that whatever you want, down to a wafer, you must
be olely and solely dependent on the Head Waiter for.",charles
"You must put
yourself a new-born Child into his hands.",charles
"There is no other way in which
a business untinged with Continental Vice can be conducted.",charles
"(It were
bootless to add, that if languages is required to be jabbered and English
is not good enough, both families and gentlemen had better go somewhere
else.)",charles
"When I began to settle down in this right-principled and well-conducted
House, I noticed, under the bed in No.",charles
"24 B (which it is up a angle off
the staircase, and usually put off upon the lowly-minded), a heap of
things in a corner.",charles
"I asked our Head Chambermaid in the course of the
day,

""What are them things in 24 B?""",charles
"To which she answered with a careless air, ""Somebody's Luggage.""",charles
"Regarding her with a eye not free from severity, I says, ""Whose Luggage?""",charles
"Evading my eye, she replied,

""Lor!",charles
"How should _I_ know!""",charles
"--Being, it may be right to mention, a female of some pertness, though
acquainted with her business.",charles
A Head Waiter must be either Head or Tail.,charles
"He must be at one extremity
or the other of the social scale.",charles
"He cannot be at the waist of it, or
anywhere else but the extremities.",charles
"It is for him to decide which of the
extremities.",charles
"On the eventful occasion under consideration, I give Mrs. Pratchett so
distinctly to understand my decision, that I broke her spirit as towards
myself, then and there, and for good.",charles
"Let not inconsistency be suspected
on account of my mentioning Mrs. Pratchett as ""Mrs.,"" and having formerly
remarked that a waitress must not be married.",charles
"Readers are respectfully
requested to notice that Mrs. Pratchett was not a waitress, but a
chambermaid.",charles
"Now a chambermaid _may_ be married; if Head, generally is
married,--or says so.",charles
"It comes to the same thing as expressing what is
customary.",charles
(N.B.,charles
"Mr. Pratchett is in Australia, and his address there is
""the Bush."")",charles
"Having took Mrs. Pratchett down as many pegs as was essential to the
future happiness of all parties, I requested her to explain herself.",charles
"""For instance,"" I says, to give her a little encouragement, ""who is
Somebody?""",charles
"""I give you my sacred honour, Mr. Christopher,"" answers Pratchett, ""that
I haven't the faintest notion.""",charles
"But for the manner in which she settled her cap-strings, I should have
doubted this; but in respect of positiveness it was hardly to be
discriminated from an affidavit.",charles
"""Then you never saw him?""",charles
I followed her up with.,charles
"""Nor yet,"" said Mrs. Pratchett, shutting her eyes and making as if she
had just took a pill of unusual circumference,--which gave a remarkable
force to her denial,--""nor yet any servant in this house.",charles
"All have been
changed, Mr. Christopher, within five year, and Somebody left his Luggage
here before then.""",charles
Inquiry of Miss Martin yielded (in the language of the Bard of A.1.),charles
"""confirmation strong.""",charles
So it had really and truly happened.,charles
"Miss Martin
is the young lady at the bar as makes out our bills; and though higher
than I could wish considering her station, is perfectly well-behaved.",charles
"Farther investigations led to the disclosure that there was a bill
against this Luggage to the amount of two sixteen six.",charles
"The Luggage had
been lying under the bedstead of 24 B over six year.",charles
"The bedstead is a
four-poster, with a deal of old hanging and valance, and is, as I once
said, probably connected with more than 24 Bs,--which I remember my
hearers was pleased to laugh at, at the time.",charles
"I don't know why,--when DO we know why?--but this Luggage laid heavy on
my mind.",charles
"I fell a wondering about Somebody, and what he had got and been
up to.",charles
"I couldn't satisfy my thoughts why he should leave so much
Luggage against so small a bill.",charles
"For I had the Luggage out within a day
or two and turned it over, and the following were the items:--A black
portmanteau, a black bag, a desk, a dressing-case, a brown-paper parcel,
a hat-box, and an umbrella strapped to a walking-stick.",charles
"It was all very
dusty and fluey.",charles
"I had our porter up to get under the bed and fetch it
out; and though he habitually wallows in dust,--swims in it from morning
to night, and wears a close-fitting waistcoat with black calimanco
sleeves for the purpose,--it made him sneeze again, and his throat was
that hot with it that it was obliged to be cooled with a drink of
Allsopp's draft.",charles
"The Luggage so got the better of me, that instead of having it put back
when it was well dusted and washed with a wet cloth,--previous to which
it was so covered with feathers that you might have thought it was
turning into poultry, and would by-and-by begin to Lay,--I say, instead
of having it put back, I had it carried into one of my places
down-stairs.",charles
"There from time to time I stared at it and stared at it,
till it seemed to grow big and grow little, and come forward at me and
retreat again, and go through all manner of performances resembling
intoxication.",charles
"When this had lasted weeks,--I may say months, and not be
far out,--I one day thought of asking Miss Martin for the particulars of
the Two sixteen six total.",charles
"She was so obliging as to extract it from the
books,--it dating before her time,--and here follows a true copy:

be ready when he called for it.",charles
Never called.,charles
"* * * * *

So far from throwing a light upon the subject, this bill appeared to me,
if I may so express my doubts, to involve it in a yet more lurid halo.",charles
"Speculating it over with the Mistress, she informed me that the luggage
had been advertised in the Master's time as being to be sold after such
and such a day to pay expenses, but no farther steps had been taken.",charles
"(I
may here remark, that the Mistress is a widow in her fourth year.",charles
"The
Master was possessed of one of those unfortunate constitutions in which
Spirits turns to Water, and rises in the ill-starred Victim.)",charles
"My speculating it over, not then only, but repeatedly, sometimes with the
Mistress, sometimes with one, sometimes with another, led up to the
Mistress's saying to me,--whether at first in joke or in earnest, or half
joke and half earnest, it matters not:

""Christopher, I am going to make you a handsome offer.""",charles
"(If this should meet her eye,--a lovely blue,--may she not take it ill my
mentioning that if I had been eight or ten year younger, I would have
done as much by her!",charles
"That is, I would have made her a offer.",charles
"It is for
others than me to denominate it a handsome one.)",charles
"""Christopher, I am going to make you a handsome offer.""",charles
"""Put a name to it, ma'am.""",charles
"""Look here, Christopher.",charles
Run over the articles of Somebody's Luggage.,charles
"You've got it all by heart, I know.""",charles
"""A black portmanteau, ma'am, a black bag, a desk, a dressing-case, a
brown-paper parcel, a hat-box, and an umbrella strapped to a
walking-stick.""",charles
"""All just as they were left.",charles
"Nothing opened, nothing tampered with.""",charles
"""You are right, ma'am.",charles
"All locked but the brown-paper parcel, and that
sealed.""",charles
"The Mistress was leaning on Miss Martin's desk at the bar-window, and she
taps the open book that lays upon the desk,--she has a pretty-made hand
to be sure,--and bobs her head over it and laughs.",charles
"""Come,"" says she, ""Christopher.",charles
"Pay me Somebody's bill, and you shall
have Somebody's Luggage.""",charles
"I rather took to the idea from the first moment; but,

""It mayn't be worth the money,"" I objected, seeming to hold back.",charles
"""That's a Lottery,"" says the Mistress, folding her arms upon the book,--it
ain't her hands alone that's pretty made, the observation extends right
up her arms.",charles
"""Won't you venture two pound sixteen shillings and sixpence
in the Lottery?",charles
"Why, there's no blanks!""",charles
"says the Mistress; laughing and
bobbing her head again, ""you _must_ win.",charles
"If you lose, you must win!",charles
"All
prizes in this Lottery!",charles
"Draw a blank, and remember, Gentlemen-Sportsmen,
you'll still be entitled to a black portmanteau, a black bag, a desk, a
dressing-case, a sheet of brown paper, a hat-box, and an umbrella
strapped to a walking-stick!""",charles
"To make short of it, Miss Martin come round me, and Mrs. Pratchett come
round me, and the Mistress she was completely round me already, and all
the women in the house come round me, and if it had been Sixteen two
instead of Two sixteen, I should have thought myself well out of it.",charles
"For
what can you do when they do come round you?",charles
So I paid the money--down--and such a laughing as there was among 'em!,charles
"But I turned the tables on 'em regularly, when I said:

""My family-name is Blue-Beard.",charles
"I'm going to open Somebody's Luggage all
alone in the Secret Chamber, and not a female eye catches sight of the
contents!""",charles
"Whether I thought proper to have the firmness to keep to this, don't
signify, or whether any female eye, and if any, how many, was really
present when the opening of the Luggage came off.",charles
"Somebody's Luggage is
the question at present: Nobody's eyes, nor yet noses.",charles
"What I still look at most, in connection with that Luggage, is the
extraordinary quantity of writing-paper, and all written on!",charles
"And not our
paper neither,--not the paper charged in the bill, for we know our
paper,--so he must have been always at it.",charles
"And he had crumpled up this
writing of his, everywhere, in every part and parcel of his luggage.",charles
"There was writing in his dressing-case, writing in his boots, writing
among his shaving-tackle, writing in his hat-box, writing folded away
down among the very whalebones of his umbrella.",charles
"His clothes wasn't bad, what there was of 'em.",charles
"His dressing-case was
poor,--not a particle of silver stopper,--bottle apertures with nothing
in 'em, like empty little dog-kennels,--and a most searching description
of tooth-powder diffusing itself around, as under a deluded mistake that
all the chinks in the fittings was divisions in teeth.",charles
"His clothes I
parted with, well enough, to a second-hand dealer not far from St.
Clement's Danes, in the Strand,--him as the officers in the Army mostly
dispose of their uniforms to, when hard pressed with debts of honour, if
I may judge from their coats and epaulets diversifying the window with
their backs towards the public.",charles
"The same party bought in one lot the
portmanteau, the bag, the desk, the dressing-case, the hat-box, the
umbrella, strap, and walking-stick.",charles
"On my remarking that I should have
thought those articles not quite in his line, he said: ""No more ith a
man'th grandmother, Mithter Chrithtopher; but if any man will bring hith
grandmother here, and offer her at a fair trifle below what the'll feth
with good luck when the'th thcoured and turned--I'll buy her!""",charles
"These transactions brought me home, and, indeed, more than home, for they
left a goodish profit on the original investment.",charles
"And now there remained
the writings; and the writings I particular wish to bring under the
candid attention of the reader.",charles
"I wish to do so without postponement, for this reason.",charles
"That is to say,
namely, viz.",charles
"i.e., as follows, thus:--Before I proceed to recount the
mental sufferings of which I became the prey in consequence of the
writings, and before following up that harrowing tale with a statement of
the wonderful and impressive catastrophe, as thrilling in its nature as
unlooked for in any other capacity, which crowned the ole and filled the
cup of unexpectedness to overflowing, the writings themselves ought to
stand forth to view.",charles
Therefore it is that they now come next.,charles
"One word
to introduce them, and I lay down my pen (I hope, my unassuming pen)
until I take it up to trace the gloomy sequel of a mind with something on
it.",charles
"He was a smeary writer, and wrote a dreadful bad hand.",charles
"Utterly
regardless of ink, he lavished it on every undeserving object--on his
clothes, his desk, his hat, the handle of his tooth-brush, his umbrella.",charles
Ink was found freely on the coffee-room carpet by No.,charles
"4 table, and two
blots was on his restless couch.",charles
﻿CHAPTER I.,charles
"THE DAWN


An ancient English Cathedral Tower?",charles
"How can the ancient English
Cathedral tower be here!",charles
"The well-known massive gray square tower of
its old Cathedral?",charles
How can that be here!,charles
"There is no spike of rusty
iron in the air, between the eye and it, from any point of the real
prospect.",charles
"What is the spike that intervenes, and who has set it up?",charles
"Maybe it is set up by the Sultan’s orders for the impaling of a horde
of Turkish robbers, one by one.",charles
"It is so, for cymbals clash, and the
Sultan goes by to his palace in long procession.",charles
"Ten thousand scimitars
flash in the sunlight, and thrice ten thousand dancing-girls strew
flowers.",charles
"Then, follow white elephants caparisoned in countless gorgeous
colours, and infinite in number and attendants.",charles
"Still the Cathedral
Tower rises in the background, where it cannot be, and still no
writhing figure is on the grim spike.",charles
Stay!,charles
"Is the spike so low a thing
as the rusty spike on the top of a post of an old bedstead that has
tumbled all awry?",charles
"Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be devoted
to the consideration of this possibility.",charles
"Shaking from head to foot, the man whose scattered consciousness has
thus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, supports
his trembling frame upon his arms, and looks around.",charles
"He is in the
meanest and closest of small rooms.",charles
"Through the ragged window-curtain,
the light of early day steals in from a miserable court.",charles
"He lies,
dressed, across a large unseemly bed, upon a bedstead that has indeed
given way under the weight upon it.",charles
"Lying, also dressed and also across
the bed, not longwise, are a Chinaman, a Lascar, and a haggard woman.",charles
"The two first are in a sleep or stupor; the last is blowing at a kind
of pipe, to kindle it.",charles
"And as she blows, and shading it with her lean
hand, concentrates its red spark of light, it serves in the dim morning
as a lamp to show him what he sees of her.",charles
"“Another?” says this woman, in a querulous, rattling whisper.",charles
"“Have
another?”

He looks about him, with his hand to his forehead.",charles
"“Ye’ve smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight,” the woman
goes on, as she chronically complains.",charles
"“Poor me, poor me, my head is so
bad.",charles
Them two come in after ye.,charles
"Ah, poor me, the business is slack, is
slack!",charles
"Few Chinamen about the Docks, and fewer Lascars, and no ships
coming in, these say!",charles
"Here’s another ready for ye, deary.",charles
"Ye’ll
remember like a good soul, won’t ye, that the market price is dreffle
high just now?",charles
More nor three shillings and sixpence for a thimbleful!,charles
"And ye’ll remember that nobody but me (and Jack Chinaman t’other side
the court; but he can’t do it as well as me) has the true secret of
mixing it?",charles
"Ye’ll pay up accordingly, deary, won’t ye?”

She blows at the pipe as she speaks, and, occasionally bubbling at it,
inhales much of its contents.",charles
"“O me, O me, my lungs is weak, my lungs is bad!",charles
"It’s nearly ready for
ye, deary.",charles
"Ah, poor me, poor me, my poor hand shakes like to drop off!",charles
"I see ye coming-to, and I ses to my poor self, ‘I’ll have another ready
for him, and he’ll bear in mind the market price of opium, and pay
according.’ O my poor head!",charles
"I makes my pipes of old penny ink-bottles,
ye see, deary—this is one—and I fits-in a mouthpiece, this way, and I
takes my mixter out of this thimble with this little horn spoon; and so
I fills, deary.",charles
"Ah, my poor nerves!",charles
"I got Heavens-hard drunk for
sixteen year afore I took to this; but this don’t hurt me, not to speak
of.",charles
"And it takes away the hunger as well as wittles, deary.”

She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe, and sinks back, turning over on
her face.",charles
"He rises unsteadily from the bed, lays the pipe upon the hearth-stone,
draws back the ragged curtain, and looks with repugnance at his three
companions.",charles
"He notices that the woman has opium-smoked herself into a
strange likeness of the Chinaman.",charles
"His form of cheek, eye, and temple,
and his colour, are repeated in her.",charles
"Said Chinaman convulsively
wrestles with one of his many Gods or Devils, perhaps, and snarls
horribly.",charles
The Lascar laughs and dribbles at the mouth.,charles
"The hostess is
still.",charles
"[Illustration: In the Court]


“What visions can _she_ have?” the waking man muses, as he turns her
face towards him, and stands looking down at it.",charles
"“Visions of many
butchers’ shops, and public-houses, and much credit?",charles
"Of an increase of
hideous customers, and this horrible bedstead set upright again, and
this horrible court swept clean?",charles
"What can she rise to, under any
quantity of opium, higher than that!—Eh?”

He bends down his ear, to listen to her mutterings.",charles
"“Unintelligible!”

As he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her face
and limbs, like fitful lightning out of a dark sky, some contagion in
them seizes upon him: insomuch that he has to withdraw himself to a
lean arm-chair by the hearth—placed there, perhaps, for such
emergencies—and to sit in it, holding tight, until he has got the
better of this unclean spirit of imitation.",charles
"Then he comes back, pounces on the Chinaman, and seizing him with both
hands by the throat, turns him violently on the bed.",charles
"The Chinaman
clutches the aggressive hands, resists, gasps, and protests.",charles
"“What do you say?”

A watchful pause.",charles
"“Unintelligible!”

Slowly loosening his grasp as he listens to the incoherent jargon with
an attentive frown, he turns to the Lascar and fairly drags him forth
upon the floor.",charles
"As he falls, the Lascar starts into a half-risen
attitude, glares with his eyes, lashes about him fiercely with his
arms, and draws a phantom knife.",charles
"It then becomes apparent that the
woman has taken possession of this knife, for safety’s sake; for, she
too starting up, and restraining and expostulating with him, the knife
is visible in her dress, not in his, when they drowsily drop back, side
by side.",charles
"There has been chattering and clattering enough between them, but to no
purpose.",charles
"When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had
no sense or sequence.",charles
"Wherefore “unintelligible!” is again the comment
of the watcher, made with some reassured nodding of his head, and a
gloomy smile.",charles
"He then lays certain silver money on the table, finds his
hat, gropes his way down the broken stairs, gives a good morning to
some rat-ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a black hutch beneath the stairs,
and passes out.",charles
"That same afternoon, the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral
rises before the sight of a jaded traveller.",charles
"The bells are going for
daily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from
his haste to reach the open Cathedral door.",charles
"The choir are getting on
their sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them, gets
on his own robe, and falls into the procession filing in to service.",charles
"Then, the Sacristan locks the iron-barred gates that divide the
sanctuary from the chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled
into their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words, “WHEN
THE WICKED MAN—” rise among groins of arches and beams of roof,
awakening muttered thunder.",charles
CHAPTER II.,charles
"A DEAN, AND A CHAPTER ALSO


Whosoever has observed that sedate and clerical bird, the rook, may
perhaps have noticed that when he wings his way homeward towards
nightfall, in a sedate and clerical company, two rooks will suddenly
detach themselves from the rest, will retrace their flight for some
distance, and will there poise and linger; conveying to mere men the
fancy that it is of some occult importance to the body politic, that
this artful couple should pretend to have renounced connection with it.",charles
"Similarly, service being over in the old Cathedral with the square
tower, and the choir scuffling out again, and divers venerable persons
of rook-like aspect dispersing, two of these latter retrace their
steps, and walk together in the echoing Close.",charles
"Not only is the day waning, but the year.",charles
"The low sun is fiery and yet
cold behind the monastery ruin, and the Virginia creeper on the
Cathedral wall has showered half its deep-red leaves down on the
pavement.",charles
"There has been rain this afternoon, and a wintry shudder goes
among the little pools on the cracked, uneven flag-stones, and through
the giant elm-trees as they shed a gust of tears.",charles
"Their fallen leaves
lie strewn thickly about.",charles
"Some of these leaves, in a timid rush, seek
sanctuary within the low arched Cathedral door; but two men coming out
resist them, and cast them forth again with their feet; this done, one
of the two locks the door with a goodly key, and the other flits away
with a folio music-book.",charles
“Mr.,charles
"Jasper was that, Tope?”

“Yes, Mr. Dean.”

“He has stayed late.”

“Yes, Mr. Dean.",charles
"I have stayed for him, your Reverence.",charles
"He has been took
a little poorly.”

“Say ‘taken,’ Tope—to the Dean,” the younger rook interposes in a low
tone with this touch of correction, as who should say: “You may offer
bad grammar to the laity, or the humbler clergy, not to the Dean.”

Mr. Tope, Chief Verger and Showman, and accustomed to be high with
excursion parties, declines with a silent loftiness to perceive that
any suggestion has been tendered to him.",charles
"“And when and how has Mr. Jasper been taken—for, as Mr. Crisparkle has
remarked, it is better to say taken—taken—” repeats the Dean; “when and
how has Mr. Jasper been Taken—”

“Taken, sir,” Tope deferentially murmurs.",charles
"“—Poorly, Tope?”

“Why, sir, Mr. Jasper was that breathed—”

“I wouldn’t say ‘That breathed,’ Tope,” Mr. Crisparkle interposes with
the same touch as before.",charles
"“Not English—to the Dean.”

“Breathed to that extent,” the Dean (not unflattered by this indirect
homage) condescendingly remarks, “would be preferable.”

“Mr.",charles
"Jasper’s breathing was so remarkably short”—thus discreetly does
Mr. Tope work his way round the sunken rock—“when he came in, that it
distressed him mightily to get his notes out: which was perhaps the
cause of his having a kind of fit on him after a little.",charles
"His memory
grew DAZED.” Mr. Tope, with his eyes on the Reverend Mr. Crisparkle,
shoots this word out, as defying him to improve upon it: “and a dimness
and giddiness crept over him as strange as ever I saw: though he didn’t
seem to mind it particularly, himself.",charles
"However, a little time and a
little water brought him out of his DAZE.” Mr. Tope repeats the word
and its emphasis, with the air of saying: “As I _have_ made a success,
I’ll make it again.”

“And Mr. Jasper has gone home quite himself, has he?” asked the Dean.",charles
"“Your Reverence, he has gone home quite himself.",charles
"And I’m glad to see
he’s having his fire kindled up, for it’s chilly after the wet, and the
Cathedral had both a damp feel and a damp touch this afternoon, and he
was very shivery.”

They all three look towards an old stone gatehouse crossing the Close,
with an arched thoroughfare passing beneath it.",charles
"Through its latticed
window, a fire shines out upon the fast-darkening scene, involving in
shadow the pendent masses of ivy and creeper covering the building’s
front.",charles
"As the deep Cathedral-bell strikes the hour, a ripple of wind
goes through these at their distance, like a ripple of the solemn sound
that hums through tomb and tower, broken niche and defaced statue, in
the pile close at hand.",charles
“Is Mr. Jasper’s nephew with him?” the Dean asks.,charles
"“No, sir,” replied the Verger, “but expected.",charles
"There’s his own solitary
shadow betwixt his two windows—the one looking this way, and the one
looking down into the High Street—drawing his own curtains now.”

“Well, well,” says the Dean, with a sprightly air of breaking up the
little conference, “I hope Mr. Jasper’s heart may not be too much set
upon his nephew.",charles
"Our affections, however laudable, in this transitory
world, should never master us; we should guide them, guide them.",charles
"I find
I am not disagreeably reminded of my dinner, by hearing my dinner-bell.",charles
"Perhaps, Mr. Crisparkle, you will, before going home, look in on
Jasper?”

“Certainly, Mr. Dean.",charles
"And tell him that you had the kindness to desire
to know how he was?”

“Ay; do so, do so.",charles
Certainly.,charles
Wished to know how he was.,charles
By all means.,charles
"Wished to know how he was.”

With a pleasant air of patronage, the Dean as nearly cocks his quaint
hat as a Dean in good spirits may, and directs his comely gaiters
towards the ruddy dining-room of the snug old red-brick house where he
is at present, “in residence” with Mrs. Dean and Miss Dean.",charles
"Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, fair and rosy, and perpetually pitching
himself head-foremost into all the deep running water in the
surrounding country; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon, early riser, musical,
classical, cheerful, kind, good-natured, social, contented, and
boy-like; Mr. Crisparkle, Minor Canon and good man, lately “Coach” upon
the chief Pagan high roads, but since promoted by a patron (grateful
for a well-taught son) to his present Christian beat; betakes himself
to the gatehouse, on his way home to his early tea.",charles
"“Sorry to hear from Tope that you have not been well, Jasper.”

“O, it was nothing, nothing!”

“You look a little worn.”

“Do I?",charles
"O, I don’t think so.",charles
"What is better, I don’t feel so.",charles
"Tope has
made too much of it, I suspect.",charles
"It’s his trade to make the most of
everything appertaining to the Cathedral, you know.”

“I may tell the Dean—I call expressly from the Dean—that you are all
right again?”

The reply, with a slight smile, is: “Certainly; with my respects and
thanks to the Dean.”

“I’m glad to hear that you expect young Drood.”

“I expect the dear fellow every moment.”

“Ah!",charles
"He will do you more good than a doctor, Jasper.”

“More good than a dozen doctors.",charles
"For I love him dearly, and I don’t
love doctors, or doctors’ stuff.”

Mr. Jasper is a dark man of some six-and-twenty, with thick, lustrous,
well-arranged black hair and whiskers.",charles
"He looks older than he is, as
dark men often do.",charles
"His voice is deep and good, his face and figure are
good, his manner is a little sombre.",charles
"His room is a little sombre, and
may have had its influence in forming his manner.",charles
"It is mostly in
shadow.",charles
"Even when the sun shines brilliantly, it seldom touches the
grand piano in the recess, or the folio music-books on the stand, or
the book-shelves on the wall, or the unfinished picture of a blooming
schoolgirl hanging over the chimneypiece; her flowing brown hair tied
with a blue riband, and her beauty remarkable for a quite childish,
almost babyish, touch of saucy discontent, comically conscious of
itself.",charles
"(There is not the least artistic merit in this picture, which
is a mere daub; but it is clear that the painter has made it
humorously—one might almost say, revengefully—like the original.)",charles
"“We shall miss you, Jasper, at the ‘Alternate Musical Wednesdays’
to-night; but no doubt you are best at home.",charles
Good-night.,charles
God bless you!,charles
"‘Tell me, shep-herds, te-e-ell me; tell me-e-e, have you seen (have you
seen, have you seen, have you seen) my-y-y Flo-o-ora-a pass this way!’”
Melodiously good Minor Canon the Reverend Septimus Crisparkle thus
delivers himself, in musical rhythm, as he withdraws his amiable face
from the doorway and conveys it down-stairs.",charles
"Sounds of recognition and greeting pass between the Reverend Septimus
and somebody else, at the stair-foot.",charles
"Mr. Jasper listens, starts from
his chair, and catches a young fellow in his arms, exclaiming:

“My dear Edwin!”

“My dear Jack!",charles
"So glad to see you!”

“Get off your greatcoat, bright boy, and sit down here in your own
corner.",charles
Your feet are not wet?,charles
Pull your boots off.,charles
"Do pull your boots
off.”

“My dear Jack, I am as dry as a bone.",charles
"Don’t moddley-coddley, there’s a
good fellow.",charles
"I like anything better than being moddley-coddleyed.”

With the check upon him of being unsympathetically restrained in a
genial outburst of enthusiasm, Mr. Jasper stands still, and looks on
intently at the young fellow, divesting himself of his outward coat,
hat, gloves, and so forth.",charles
"Once for all, a look of intentness and
intensity—a look of hungry, exacting, watchful, and yet devoted
affection—is always, now and ever afterwards, on the Jasper face
whenever the Jasper face is addressed in this direction.",charles
"And whenever
it is so addressed, it is never, on this occasion or on any other,
dividedly addressed; it is always concentrated.",charles
"“Now I am right, and now I’ll take my corner, Jack.",charles
"Any dinner, Jack?”

Mr. Jasper opens a door at the upper end of the room, and discloses a
small inner room pleasantly lighted and prepared, wherein a comely dame
is in the act of setting dishes on table.",charles
"“What a jolly old Jack it is!” cries the young fellow, with a clap of
his hands.",charles
"“Look here, Jack; tell me; whose birthday is it?”

“Not yours, I know,” Mr. Jasper answers, pausing to consider.",charles
"“Not mine, you know?",charles
"No; not mine, _I_ know!",charles
"Pussy’s!”

Fixed as the look the young fellow meets is, there is yet in it some
strange power of suddenly including the sketch over the chimneypiece.",charles
"“Pussy’s, Jack!",charles
We must drink Many happy returns to her.,charles
"Come, uncle;
take your dutiful and sharp-set nephew in to dinner.”

As the boy (for he is little more) lays a hand on Jasper’s shoulder,
Jasper cordially and gaily lays a hand on _his_ shoulder, and so
Marseillaise-wise they go in to dinner.",charles
"“And, Lord!",charles
here’s Mrs. Tope!” cries the boy.,charles
"“Lovelier than ever!”

“Never you mind me, Master Edwin,” retorts the Verger’s wife; “I can
take care of myself.”

“You can’t.",charles
You’re much too handsome.,charles
"Give me a kiss because it’s
Pussy’s birthday.”

“I’d Pussy you, young man, if I was Pussy, as you call her,” Mrs. Tope
blushingly retorts, after being saluted.",charles
"“Your uncle’s too much wrapt
up in you, that’s where it is.",charles
"He makes so much of you, that it’s my
opinion you think you’ve only to call your Pussys by the dozen, to make
’em come.”

“You forget, Mrs. Tope,” Mr. Jasper interposes, taking his place at the
table with a genial smile, “and so do you, Ned, that Uncle and Nephew
are words prohibited here by common consent and express agreement.",charles
"For
what we are going to receive His holy name be praised!”

“Done like the Dean!",charles
"Witness, Edwin Drood!",charles
"Please to carve, Jack, for I
can’t.”

This sally ushers in the dinner.",charles
"Little to the present purpose, or to
any purpose, is said, while it is in course of being disposed of.",charles
"At
length the cloth is drawn, and a dish of walnuts and a decanter of
rich-coloured sherry are placed upon the table.",charles
“I say!,charles
"Tell me, Jack,” the young fellow then flows on: “do you really
and truly feel as if the mention of our relationship divided us at all?",charles
"_I_ don’t.”

“Uncles as a rule, Ned, are so much older than their nephews,” is the
reply, “that I have that feeling instinctively.”

“As a rule!",charles
"Ah, may-be!",charles
"But what is a difference in age of half-a-dozen
years or so?",charles
"And some uncles, in large families, are even younger than
their nephews.",charles
"By George, I wish it was the case with us!”

“Why?”

“Because if it was, I’d take the lead with you, Jack, and be as wise as
Begone, dull Care!",charles
"that turned a young man gray, and Begone, dull Care!",charles
"that turned an old man to clay.—Halloa, Jack!",charles
"Don’t drink.”

“Why not?”

“Asks why not, on Pussy’s birthday, and no Happy returns proposed!",charles
"Pussy, Jack, and many of ’em!",charles
"Happy returns, I mean.”

Laying an affectionate and laughing touch on the boy’s extended hand,
as if it were at once his giddy head and his light heart, Mr. Jasper
drinks the toast in silence.",charles
"“Hip, hip, hip, and nine times nine, and one to finish with, and all
that, understood.",charles
"Hooray, hooray, hooray!—And now, Jack, let’s have a
little talk about Pussy.",charles
Two pairs of nut-crackers?,charles
"Pass me one, and
take the other.” Crack.",charles
"“How’s Pussy getting on Jack?”

“With her music?",charles
"Fairly.”

“What a dreadfully conscientious fellow you are, Jack!",charles
"But _I_ know,
Lord bless you!",charles
"Inattentive, isn’t she?”

“She can learn anything, if she will.”

“_If_ she will!",charles
"Egad, that’s it.",charles
"But if she won’t?”

Crack!—on Mr. Jasper’s part.",charles
"“How’s she looking, Jack?”

Mr. Jasper’s concentrated face again includes the portrait as he
returns: “Very like your sketch indeed.”

“I _am_ a little proud of it,” says the young fellow, glancing up at
the sketch with complacency, and then shutting one eye, and taking a
corrected prospect of it over a level bridge of nut-crackers in the
air: “Not badly hit off from memory.",charles
"But I ought to have caught that
expression pretty well, for I have seen it often enough.”

Crack!—on Edwin Drood’s part.",charles
Crack!—on Mr. Jasper’s part.,charles
"“In point of fact,” the former resumes, after some silent dipping among
his fragments of walnut with an air of pique, “I see it whenever I go
to see Pussy.",charles
"If I don’t find it on her face, I leave it there.—You
know I do, Miss Scornful Pert.",charles
"Booh!” With a twirl of the nut-crackers
at the portrait.",charles
Crack!,charles
crack!,charles
crack.,charles
"Slowly, on Mr. Jasper’s part.",charles
Crack.,charles
Sharply on the part of Edwin Drood.,charles
Silence on both sides.,charles
"“Have you lost your tongue, Jack?”

“Have you found yours, Ned?”

“No, but really;—isn’t it, you know, after all—”

Mr. Jasper lifts his dark eyebrows inquiringly.",charles
“Isn’t it unsatisfactory to be cut off from choice in such a matter?,charles
"There, Jack!",charles
I tell you!,charles
"If I could choose, I would choose Pussy from
all the pretty girls in the world.”

“But you have not got to choose.”

“That’s what I complain of.",charles
"My dead and gone father and Pussy’s dead
and gone father must needs marry us together by anticipation.",charles
"Why
the—Devil, I was going to say, if it had been respectful to their
memory—couldn’t they leave us alone?”

“Tut, tut, dear boy,” Mr. Jasper remonstrates, in a tone of gentle
deprecation.",charles
"“Tut, tut?",charles
"Yes, Jack, it’s all very well for _you_.",charles
"_You_ can take it
easily.",charles
"_Your_ life is not laid down to scale, and lined and dotted out
for you, like a surveyor’s plan.",charles
"_You_ have no uncomfortable suspicion
that you are forced upon anybody, nor has anybody an uncomfortable
suspicion that she is forced upon you, or that you are forced upon her.",charles
_You_ can choose for yourself.,charles
"Life, for _you_, is a plum with the
natural bloom on; it hasn’t been over-carefully wiped off for _you_—”

“Don’t stop, dear fellow.",charles
"Go on.”

“Can I anyhow have hurt your feelings, Jack?”

“How can you have hurt my feelings?”

“Good Heaven, Jack, you look frightfully ill!",charles
"﻿CHAPTER I


ANTHONY PATCH

In 1913, when Anthony Patch was twenty-five, two years were already gone
since irony, the Holy Ghost of this later day, had, theoretically at
least, descended upon him.",f
"Irony was the final polish of the shoe, the
ultimate dab of the clothes-brush, a sort of intellectual ""There!""",f
"--yet
at the brink of this story he has as yet gone no further than the
conscious stage.",f
"As you first see him he wonders frequently whether he
is not without honor and slightly mad, a shameful and obscene thinness
glistening on the surface of the world like oil on a clean pond, these
occasions being varied, of course, with those in which he thinks himself
rather an exceptional young man, thoroughly sophisticated, well adjusted
to his environment, and somewhat more significant than any one else
he knows.",f
"This was his healthy state and it made him cheerful, pleasant, and very
attractive to intelligent men and to all women.",f
"In this state he
considered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that
the elect would deem worthy and, passing on, would join the dimmer stars
in a nebulous, indeterminate heaven half-way between death and
immortality.",f
"Until the time came for this effort he would be Anthony
Patch--not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality,
opinionated, contemptuous, functioning from within outward--a man who
was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor, who knew the
sophistry of courage and yet was brave.",f
"A WORTHY MAN AND HIS GIFTED SON

Anthony drew as much consciousness of social security from being the
grandson of Adam J. Patch as he would have had from tracing his line
over the sea to the crusaders.",f
"This is inevitable; Virginians and
Bostonians to the contrary notwithstanding, an aristocracy founded
sheerly on money postulates wealth in the particular.",f
"Now Adam J. Patch, more familiarly known as ""Cross Patch,"" left his
father's farm in Tarrytown early in sixty-one to join a New York cavalry
regiment.",f
"He came home from the war a major, charged into Wall Street,
and amid much fuss, fume, applause, and ill will he gathered to himself
some seventy-five million dollars.",f
This occupied his energies until he was fifty-seven years old.,f
"It was
then that he determined, after a severe attack of sclerosis, to
consecrate the remainder of his life to the moral regeneration of the
world.",f
He became a reformer among reformers.,f
"Emulating the magnificent
efforts of Anthony Comstock, after whom his grandson was named, he
levelled a varied assortment of uppercuts and body-blows at liquor,
literature, vice, art, patent medicines, and Sunday theatres.",f
"His mind,
under the influence of that insidious mildew which eventually forms on
all but the few, gave itself up furiously to every indignation of the
age.",f
"From an armchair in the office of his Tarrytown estate he directed
against the enormous hypothetical enemy, unrighteousness, a campaign
which went on through fifteen years, during which he displayed himself a
rabid monomaniac, an unqualified nuisance, and an intolerable bore.",f
"The
year in which this story opens found him wearying; his campaign had
grown desultory; 1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895; his thoughts ran a
great deal on the Civil War, somewhat on his dead wife and son, almost
infinitesimally on his grandson Anthony.",f
"Early in his career Adam Patch had married an anemic lady of thirty,
Alicia Withers, who brought him one hundred thousand dollars and an
impeccable entré into the banking circles of New York.",f
"Immediately and
rather spunkily she had borne him a son and, as if completely
devitalized by the magnificence of this performance, she had thenceforth
effaced herself within the shadowy dimensions of the nursery.",f
"The boy,
Adam Ulysses Patch, became an inveterate joiner of clubs, connoisseur of
good form, and driver of tandems--at the astonishing age of twenty-six
he began his memoirs under the title ""New York Society as I Have Seen
It.""",f
"On the rumor of its conception this work was eagerly bid for among
publishers, but as it proved after his death to be immoderately verbose
and overpoweringly dull, it never obtained even a private printing.",f
This Fifth Avenue Chesterfield married at twenty-two.,f
"His wife was
Henrietta Lebrune, the Boston ""Society Contralto,"" and the single child
of the union was, at the request of his grandfather, christened Anthony
Comstock Patch.",f
"When he went to Harvard, the Comstock dropped out of his
name to a nether hell of oblivion and was never heard of thereafter.",f
"Young Anthony had one picture of his father and mother together--so
often had it faced his eyes in childhood that it had acquired the
impersonality of furniture, but every one who came into his bedroom
regarded it with interest.",f
"It showed a dandy of the nineties, spare and
handsome, standing beside a tall dark lady with a muff and the
suggestion of a bustle.",f
"Between them was a little boy with long brown
curls, dressed in a velvet Lord Fauntleroy suit.",f
"This was Anthony at
five, the year of his mother's death.",f
His memories of the Boston Society Contralto were nebulous and musical.,f
"She was a lady who sang, sang, sang, in the music room of their house on
Washington Square--sometimes with guests scattered all about her, the
men with their arms folded, balanced breathlessly on the edges of sofas,
the women with their hands in their laps, occasionally making little
whispers to the men and always clapping very briskly and uttering cooing
cries after each song--and often she sang to Anthony alone, in Italian
or French or in a strange and terrible dialect which she imagined to be
the speech of the Southern negro.",f
"His recollections of the gallant Ulysses, the first man in America to
roll the lapels of his coat, were much more vivid.",f
"After Henrietta
Lebrune Patch had ""joined another choir,"" as her widower huskily
remarked from time to time, father and son lived up at grampa's in
Tarrytown, and Ulysses came daily to Anthony's nursery and expelled
pleasant, thick-smelling words for sometimes as much as an hour.",f
"He was
continually promising Anthony hunting trips and fishing trips and
excursions to Atlantic City, ""oh, some time soon now""; but none of them
ever materialized.",f
"One trip they did take; when Anthony was eleven they
went abroad, to England and Switzerland, and there in the best hotel in
Lucerne his father died with much sweating and grunting and crying aloud
for air.",f
"In a panic of despair and terror Anthony was brought back to
America, wedded to a vague melancholy that was to stay beside him
through the rest of his life.",f
"PAST AND PERSON OF THE HERO

At eleven he had a horror of death.",f
"Within six impressionable years his
parents had died and his grandmother had faded off almost imperceptibly,
until, for the first time since her marriage, her person held for one
day an unquestioned supremacy over her own drawing room.",f
"So to Anthony
life was a struggle against death, that waited at every corner.",f
"It was
as a concession to his hypochondriacal imagination that he formed the
habit of reading in bed--it soothed him.",f
"He read until he was tired and
often fell asleep with the lights still on.",f
"His favorite diversion until he was fourteen was his stamp collection;
enormous, as nearly exhaustive as a boy's could be--his grandfather
considered fatuously that it was teaching him geography.",f
"So Anthony kept
up a correspondence with a half dozen ""Stamp and Coin"" companies and it
was rare that the mail failed to bring him new stamp-books or packages
of glittering approval sheets--there was a mysterious fascination in
transferring his acquisitions interminably from one book to another.",f
"His
stamps were his greatest happiness and he bestowed impatient frowns on
any one who interrupted him at play with them; they devoured his
allowance every month, and he lay awake at night musing untiringly on
their variety and many-colored splendor.",f
"At sixteen he had lived almost entirely within himself, an inarticulate
boy, thoroughly un-American, and politely bewildered by his
contemporaries.",f
"The two preceding years had been spent in Europe with a
private tutor, who persuaded him that Harvard was the thing; it would
""open doors,"" it would be a tremendous tonic, it would give him
innumerable self-sacrificing and devoted friends.",f
"So he went to
Harvard--there was no other logical thing to be done with him.",f
"Oblivious to the social system, he lived for a while alone and unsought
in a high room in Beck Hall--a slim dark boy of medium height with a shy
sensitive mouth.",f
His allowance was more than liberal.,f
"He laid the
foundations for a library by purchasing from a wandering bibliophile
first editions of Swinburne, Meredith, and Hardy, and a yellowed
illegible autograph letter of Keats's, finding later that he had been
amazingly overcharged.",f
"He became an exquisite dandy, amassed a rather
pathetic collection of silk pajamas, brocaded dressing-gowns, and
neckties too flamboyant to wear; in this secret finery he would parade
before a mirror in his room or lie stretched in satin along his
window-seat looking down on the yard and realizing dimly this clamor,
breathless and immediate, in which it seemed he was never to have
a part.",f
"Curiously enough he found in senior year that he had acquired a position
in his class.",f
"He learned that he was looked upon as a rather romantic
figure, a scholar, a recluse, a tower of erudition.",f
"This amused him but
secretly pleased him--he began going out, at first a little and then a
great deal.",f
He made the Pudding.,f
"He drank--quietly and in the proper
tradition.",f
"It was said of him that had he not come to college so young
he might have ""done extremely well.""",f
"In 1909, when he graduated, he was
only twenty years old.",f
"Then abroad again--to Rome this time, where he dallied with architecture
and painting in turn, took up the violin, and wrote some ghastly Italian
sonnets, supposedly the ruminations of a thirteenth-century monk on the
joys of the contemplative life.",f
"It became established among his Harvard
intimates that he was in Rome, and those of them who were abroad that
year looked him up and discovered with him, on many moonlight
excursions, much in the city that was older than the Renaissance or
indeed than the republic.",f
"Maury Noble, from Philadelphia, for instance,
remained two months, and together they realized the peculiar charm of
Latin women and had a delightful sense of being very young and free in a
civilization that was very old and free.",f
"Not a few acquaintances of his
grandfather's called on him, and had he so desired he might have been
_persona grata_ with the diplomatic set--indeed, he found that his
inclinations tended more and more toward conviviality, but that long
adolescent aloofness and consequent shyness still dictated to
his conduct.",f
"He returned to America in 1912 because of one of his grandfather's
sudden illnesses, and after an excessively tiresome talk with the
perpetually convalescent old man he decided to put off until his
grandfather's death the idea of living permanently abroad.",f
"After a
prolonged search he took an apartment on Fifty-second Street and to all
appearances settled down.",f
"In 1913 Anthony Patch's adjustment of himself to the universe was in
process of consummation.",f
"Physically, he had improved since his
undergraduate days--he was still too thin but his shoulders had widened
and his brunette face had lost the frightened look of his freshman year.",f
"He was secretly orderly and in person spick and span--his friends
declared that they had never seen his hair rumpled.",f
"His nose was too
sharp; his mouth was one of those unfortunate mirrors of mood inclined
to droop perceptibly in moments of unhappiness, but his blue eyes were
charming, whether alert with intelligence or half closed in an
expression of melancholy humor.",f
"One of those men devoid of the symmetry of feature essential to the
Aryan ideal, he was yet, here and there, considered handsome--moreover,
he was very clean, in appearance and in reality, with that especial
cleanness borrowed from beauty.",f
"THE REPROACHLESS APARTMENT

Fifth and Sixth Avenues, it seemed to Anthony, were the uprights of a
gigantic ladder stretching from Washington Square to Central Park.",f
"Coming up-town on top of a bus toward Fifty-second Street invariably
gave him the sensation of hoisting himself hand by hand on a series of
treacherous rungs, and when the bus jolted to a stop at his own rung he
found something akin to relief as he descended the reckless metal steps
to the sidewalk.",f
"After that, he had but to walk down Fifty-second Street half a block,
pass a stodgy family of brownstone houses--and then in a jiffy he was
under the high ceilings of his great front room.",f
"This was entirely
satisfactory.",f
"Here, after all, life began.",f
"Here he slept, breakfasted,
read, and entertained.",f
"The house itself was of murky material, built in the late nineties; in
response to the steadily growing need of small apartments each floor had
been thoroughly remodelled and rented individually.",f
"Of the four
apartments Anthony's, on the second floor, was the most desirable.",f
"The front room had fine high ceilings and three large windows that
loomed down pleasantly upon Fifty-second Street.",f
"In its appointments it
escaped by a safe margin being of any particular period; it escaped
stiffness, stuffiness, bareness, and decadence.",f
"It smelt neither of
smoke nor of incense--it was tall and faintly blue.",f
"There was a deep
lounge of the softest brown leather with somnolence drifting about it
like a haze.",f
"There was a high screen of Chinese lacquer chiefly
concerned with geometrical fishermen and huntsmen in black and gold;
this made a corner alcove for a voluminous chair guarded by an
orange-colored standing lamp.",f
"Deep in the fireplace a quartered shield
was burned to a murky black.",f
"Passing through the dining-room, which, as Anthony took only breakfast
at home, was merely a magnificent potentiality, and down a comparatively
long hall, one came to the heart and core of the apartment--Anthony's
bedroom and bath.",f
Both of them were immense.,f
"Under the ceilings of the former even the
great canopied bed seemed of only average size.",f
"On the floor an exotic
rug of crimson velvet was soft as fleece on his bare feet.",f
"His bathroom,
in contrast to the rather portentous character of his bedroom, was gay,
bright, extremely habitable and even faintly facetious.",f
"Framed around
the walls were photographs of four celebrated thespian beauties of the
day: Julia Sanderson as ""The Sunshine Girl,"" Ina Claire as ""The Quaker
Girl,"" Billie Burke as ""The Mind-the-Paint Girl,"" and Hazel Dawn as ""The
Pink Lady.""",f
"Between Billie Burke and Hazel Dawn hung a print
representing a great stretch of snow presided over by a cold and
formidable sun--this, claimed Anthony, symbolized the cold shower.",f
"The bathtub, equipped with an ingenious bookholder, was low and large.",f
"Beside it a wall wardrobe bulged with sufficient linen for three men and
with a generation of neckties.",f
"There was no skimpy glorified towel of a
carpet--instead, a rich rug, like the one in his bedroom a miracle of
softness, that seemed almost to massage the wet foot emerging from
the tub....

All in all a room to conjure with--it was easy to see that Anthony
dressed there, arranged his immaculate hair there, in fact did
everything but sleep and eat there.",f
"It was his pride, this bathroom.",f
"He
felt that if he had a love he would have hung her picture just facing
the tub so that, lost in the soothing steamings of the hot water, he
might lie and look up at her and muse warmly and sensuously on
her beauty.",f
"NOR DOES HE SPIN

The apartment was kept clean by an English servant with the singularly,
almost theatrically, appropriate name of Bounds, whose technic was
marred only by the fact that he wore a soft collar.",f
"Had he been entirely
Anthony's Bounds this defect would have been summarily remedied, but he
was also the Bounds of two other gentlemen in the neighborhood.",f
"From
eight until eleven in the morning he was entirely Anthony's.",f
"He arrived
with the mail and cooked breakfast.",f
"At nine-thirty he pulled the edge of
Anthony's blanket and spoke a few terse words--Anthony never remembered
clearly what they were and rather suspected they were deprecative; then
he served breakfast on a card-table in the front room, made the bed and,
after asking with some hostility if there was anything else, withdrew.",f
"In the mornings, at least once a week, Anthony went to see his broker.",f
"His income was slightly under seven thousand a year, the interest on
money inherited from his mother.",f
"His grandfather, who had never allowed
his own son to graduate from a very liberal allowance, judged that this
sum was sufficient for young Anthony's needs.",f
"Every Christmas he sent
him a five-hundred-dollar bond, which Anthony usually sold, if possible,
as he was always a little, not very, hard up.",f
"The visits to his broker varied from semi-social chats to discussions of
the safety of eight per cent investments, and Anthony always enjoyed
them.",f
"The big trust company building seemed to link him definitely to
the great fortunes whose solidarity he respected and to assure him that
he was adequately chaperoned by the hierarchy of finance.",f
"From these
hurried men he derived the same sense of safety that he had in
contemplating his grandfather's money--even more, for the latter
appeared, vaguely, a demand loan made by the world to Adam Patch's own
moral righteousness, while this money down-town seemed rather to have
been grasped and held by sheer indomitable strengths and tremendous
feats of will; in addition, it seemed more definitely and
explicitly--money.",f
"Closely as Anthony trod on the heels of his income, he considered it to
be enough.",f
"Some golden day, of course, he would have many millions;
meanwhile he possessed a _raison d'etre_ in the theoretical creation of
essays on the popes of the Renaissance.",f
"This flashes back to the
conversation with his grandfather immediately upon his return from Rome.",f
"He had hoped to find his grandfather dead, but had learned by
telephoning from the pier that Adam Patch was comparatively well
again--the next day he had concealed his disappointment and gone out to
Tarrytown.",f
"Five miles from the station his taxicab entered an
elaborately groomed drive that threaded a veritable maze of walls and
wire fences guarding the estate--this, said the public, was because it
was definitely known that if the Socialists had their way, one of the
first men they'd assassinate would be old Cross Patch.",f
"Anthony was late and the venerable philanthropist was awaiting him in a
glass-walled sun parlor, where he was glancing through the morning
papers for the second time.",f
"His secretary, Edward Shuttleworth--who
before his regeneration had been gambler, saloon-keeper, and general
reprobate--ushered Anthony into the room, exhibiting his redeemer and
benefactor as though he were displaying a treasure of immense value.",f
They shook hands gravely.,f
"""I'm awfully glad to hear you're better,""
Anthony said.",f
"The senior Patch, with an air of having seen his grandson only last
week, pulled out his watch.",f
"""Train late?""",f
he asked mildly.,f
It had irritated him to wait for Anthony.,f
"He was under the delusion not
only that in his youth he had handled his practical affairs with the
utmost scrupulousness, even to keeping every engagement on the dot, but
also that this was the direct and primary cause of his success.",f
"""It's been late a good deal this month,"" he remarked with a shade of
meek accusation in his voice--and then after a long sigh, ""Sit down.""",f
"Anthony surveyed his grandfather with that tacit amazement which always
attended the sight.",f
"That this feeble, unintelligent old man was
possessed of such power that, yellow journals to the contrary, the men
in the republic whose souls he could not have bought directly or
indirectly would scarcely have populated White Plains, seemed as
impossible to believe as that he had once been a pink-and-white baby.",f
"The span of his seventy-five years had acted as a magic bellows--the
first quarter-century had blown him full with life, and the last had
sucked it all back.",f
"It had sucked in the cheeks and the chest and the
girth of arm and leg.",f
"It had tyrannously demanded his teeth, one by one,
suspended his small eyes in dark-bluish sacks, tweeked out his hairs,
changed him from gray to white in some places, from pink to yellow in
others--callously transposing his colors like a child trying over a
paintbox.",f
Then through his body and his soul it had attacked his brain.,f
It had sent him night-sweats and tears and unfounded dreads.,f
"It had
split his intense normality into credulity and suspicion.",f
"Out of the
coarse material of his enthusiasm it had cut dozens of meek but petulant
obsessions; his energy was shrunk to the bad temper of a spoiled child,
and for his will to power was substituted a fatuous puerile desire for a
land of harps and canticles on earth.",f
"The amenities having been gingerly touched upon, Anthony felt that he
was expected to outline his intentions--and simultaneously a glimmer in
the old man's eye warned him against broaching, for the present, his
desire to live abroad.",f
"He wished that Shuttleworth would have tact
enough to leave the room--he detested Shuttleworth--but the secretary
had settled blandly in a rocker and was dividing between the two Patches
the glances of his faded eyes.",f
"""Now that you're here you ought to _do_ something,"" said his grandfather
softly, ""accomplish something.""",f
"Anthony waited for him to speak of ""leaving something done when you pass
on.""",f
"Then he made a suggestion:

""I thought--it seemed to me that perhaps I'm best qualified to write--""

Adam Patch winced, visualizing a family poet with a long hair and three
mistresses.

""",f
"--history,"" finished Anthony.",f
"""History?",f
History of what?,f
The Civil War?,f
"The Revolution?""",f
"""Why--no, sir.",f
"A history of the Middle Ages.""",f
"Simultaneously an idea was
born for a history of the Renaissance popes, written from some novel
angle.",f
"Still, he was glad he had said ""Middle Ages.""",f
"""Middle Ages?",f
Why not your own country?,f
"Something you know about?""",f
"""Well, you see I've lived so much abroad--""

""Why you should write about the Middle Ages, I don't know.",f
"Dark Ages, we
used to call 'em.",f
"Nobody knows what happened, and nobody cares, except
that they're over now.""",f
"He continued for some minutes on the uselessness
of such information, touching, naturally, on the Spanish Inquisition and
the ""corruption of the monasteries.""",f
"Then:

""Do you think you'll be able to do any work in New York--or do you
really intend to work at all?""",f
"This last with soft, almost
imperceptible, cynicism.",f
"""Why, yes, I do, sir.""",f
"""When'll you be done?""",f
"""Well, there'll be an outline, you see--and a lot of preliminary
reading.""",f
"""I should think you'd have done enough of that already.""",f
"The conversation worked itself jerkily toward a rather abrupt
conclusion, when Anthony rose, looked at his watch, and remarked that he
had an engagement with his broker that afternoon.",f
"He had intended to
stay a few days with his grandfather, but he was tired and irritated
from a rough crossing, and quite unwilling to stand a subtle and
sanctimonious browbeating.",f
"He would come out again in a few days,
he said.",f
"Nevertheless, it was due to this encounter that work had come into his
life as a permanent idea.",f
"During the year that had passed since then, he
had made several lists of authorities, he had even experimented with
chapter titles and the division of his work into periods, but not one
line of actual writing existed at present, or seemed likely ever to
exist.",f
"He did nothing--and contrary to the most accredited copy-book
logic, he managed to divert himself with more than average content.",f
"AFTERNOON

It was October in 1913, midway in a week of pleasant days, with the
sunshine loitering in the cross-streets and the atmosphere so languid as
to seem weighted with ghostly falling leaves.",f
"It was pleasant to sit
lazily by the open window finishing a chapter of ""Erewhon.""",f
"It was
pleasant to yawn about five, toss the book on a table, and saunter
humming along the hall to his bath.",f
"""To ... you ... beaut-if-ul lady,""

he was singing as he turned on the tap.",f
"""I raise ... my ... eyes;
To ... you ... beaut-if-ul la-a-dy
My ... heart ... cries--""

He raised his voice to compete with the flood of water pouring into the
tub, and as he looked at the picture of Hazel Dawn upon the wall he put
an imaginary violin to his shoulder and softly caressed it with a
phantom bow.",f
"Through his closed lips he made a humming noise, which he
vaguely imagined resembled the sound of a violin.",f
"After a moment his
hands ceased their gyrations and wandered to his shirt, which he began
to unfasten.",f
"Stripped, and adopting an athletic posture like the
tiger-skin man in the advertisement, he regarded himself with some
satisfaction in the mirror, breaking off to dabble a tentative foot in
the tub.",f
"Readjusting a faucet and indulging in a few preliminary grunts,
he slid in.",f
"Once accustomed to the temperature of the water he relaxed into a state
of drowsy content.",f
"When he finished his bath he would dress leisurely
and walk down Fifth Avenue to the Ritz, where he had an appointment for
dinner with his two most frequent companions, Dick Caramel and Maury
Noble.",f
"Afterward he and Maury were going to the theatre--Caramel would
probably trot home and work on his book, which ought to be finished
pretty soon.",f
Anthony was glad _he_ wasn't going to work on _his_ book.,f
"The notion of
sitting down and conjuring up, not only words in which to clothe
thoughts but thoughts worthy of being clothed--the whole thing was
absurdly beyond his desires.",f
"Emerging from his bath he polished himself with the meticulous attention
of a bootblack.",f
"Then he wandered into the bedroom, and whistling the
while a weird, uncertain melody, strolled here and there buttoning,
adjusting, and enjoying the warmth of the thick carpet on his feet.",f
"He lit a cigarette, tossed the match out the open top of the window,
then paused in his tracks with the cigarette two inches from his
mouth--which fell faintly ajar.",f
"His eyes were focussed upon a spot of
brilliant color on the roof of a house farther down the alley.",f
"It was a girl in a red negligé, silk surely, drying her hair by the
still hot sun of late afternoon.",f
"His whistle died upon the stiff air of
the room; he walked cautiously another step nearer the window with a
sudden impression that she was beautiful.",f
"Sitting on the stone parapet
beside her was a cushion the same color as her garment and she was
leaning both arms upon it as she looked down into the sunny areaway,
where Anthony could hear children playing.",f
He watched her for several minutes.,f
"Something was stirred in him,
something not accounted for by the warm smell of the afternoon or the
triumphant vividness of red.",f
"He felt persistently that the girl was
beautiful--then of a sudden he understood: it was her distance, not a
rare and precious distance of soul but still distance, if only in
terrestrial yards.",f
"The autumn air was between them, and the roofs and
the blurred voices.",f
"Yet for a not altogether explained second, posing
perversely in time, his emotion had been nearer to adoration than in the
deepest kiss he had ever known.",f
"He finished his dressing, found a black bow tie and adjusted it
carefully by the three-sided mirror in the bathroom.",f
"Then yielding to an
impulse he walked quickly into the bedroom and again looked out the
window.",f
"The woman was standing up now; she had tossed her hair back and
he had a full view of her.",f
"She was fat, full thirty-five, utterly
undistinguished.",f
"Making a clicking noise with his mouth he returned to
the bathroom and reparted his hair.",f
"""To ... you ... beaut-if-ul lady,""

he sang lightly,

""I raise ... my ... eyes--""

Then with a last soothing brush that left an iridescent surface of sheer
gloss he left his bathroom and his apartment and walked down Fifth
Avenue to the Ritz-Carlton.",f
"THREE MEN

At seven Anthony and his friend Maury Noble are sitting at a corner
table on the cool roof.",f
"Maury Noble is like nothing so much as a large
slender and imposing cat.",f
"His eyes are narrow and full of incessant,
protracted blinks.",f
"His hair is smooth and flat, as though it has been
licked by a possible--and, if so, Herculean--mother-cat.",f
"﻿                                I

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice
that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.",f
"“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just
remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages
that you’ve had.”

He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative
in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more
than that.",f
"In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a
habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me
the victim of not a few veteran bores.",f
"The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal
person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
unknown men.",f
"Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by
some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on
the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least
the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
marred by obvious suppressions.",f
"Reserving judgements is a matter of
infinite hope.",f
"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I
forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly
repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out
unequally at birth.",f
"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
that it has a limit.",f
"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded
on.",f
"When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted
the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
human heart.",f
"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was
exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I
have an unaffected scorn.",f
"If personality is an unbroken series of
successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related
to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
thousand miles away.",f
"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that
flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
which it is not likely I shall ever find again.",f
"No—Gatsby turned out
all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my
interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",f
"------------------------------------------------------------------------

My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle
Western city for three generations.",f
"The Carraways are something of a
clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of
Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s
brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil
War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father
carries on today.",f
"I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in
father’s office.",f
"I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of
a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that
delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.",f
"I enjoyed the
counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.",f
"Instead of being
the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the
ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond
business.",f
"Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it
could support one more single man.",f
"All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,
“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces.",f
"Father agreed to finance
me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I
thought, in the spring of twenty-two.",f
"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm
season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly
trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a
house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea.",f
"He
found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a
month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and
I went out to the country alone.",f
"I had a dog—at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who
made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to
herself over the electric stove.",f
"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more
recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.",f
“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.,f
I told him.,f
And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.,f
"I was a guide,
a pathfinder, an original settler.",f
"He had casually conferred on me the
freedom of the neighbourhood.",f
"And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar
conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.",f
"There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to
be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.",f
"I bought a dozen
volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they
stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,
promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and
Maecenas knew.",f
"And I had the high intention of reading many other
books besides.",f
"I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a
series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now
I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become
again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”
This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at
from a single window, after all.",f
"It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of
the strangest communities in North America.",f
"It was on that slender
riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where
there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of
land.",f
"Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most
domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great
wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.",f
"They are not perfect ovals—like the
egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact
end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
wonder to the gulls that fly overhead.",f
"To the wingless a more
interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular
except shape and size.",f
"I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little
sinister contrast between them.",f
"My house was at the very tip of the
egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge
places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.",f
"The one on
my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual
imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one
side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble
swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.",f
"It was
Gatsby’s mansion.",f
"Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.",f
"My own house was an
eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I
had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a
month.",f
"Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins
on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom
Buchanans.",f
"Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom
in college.",f
"And just after the war I spent two days with them in
Chicago.",f
"Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of
the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a
national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute
limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of
anticlimax.",f
"His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his
freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago
and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for
instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake
Forest.",f
"It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was
wealthy enough to do that.",f
Why they came East I don’t know.,f
"They had spent a year in France for
no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully
wherever people played polo and were rich together.",f
"This was a
permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe
it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift
on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of
some irrecoverable football game.",f
"And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East
Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.",f
"Their house
was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white
Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay.",f
"The lawn started at
the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,
jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when
it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though
from the momentum of its run.",f
"The front was broken by a line of French
windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm
windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with
his legs apart on the front porch.",f
He had changed since his New Haven years.,f
"Now he was a sturdy
straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a
supercilious manner.",f
"Two shining arrogant eyes had established
dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward.",f
"Not even the effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill
those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could
see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his
thin coat.",f
It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.,f
"His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
fractiousness he conveyed.",f
"There was a touch of paternal contempt in
it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who
had hated his guts.",f
"“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to
say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We
were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I
always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like
him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.",f
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.,f
"“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.",f
"Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the
front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped
the tide offshore.",f
"“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,
politely and abruptly.",f
"“We’ll go inside.”

We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,
fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.",f
"The
windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside
that seemed to grow a little way into the house.",f
"A breeze blew through
the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale
flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the
ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow
on it as wind does on the sea.",f
"The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous
couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an
anchored balloon.",f
"They were both in white, and their dresses were
rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a
short flight around the house.",f
"I must have stood for a few moments
listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a
picture on the wall.",f
"Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the
rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the
curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the
floor.",f
The younger of the two was a stranger to me.,f
"She was extended full
length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her
chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which
was quite likely to fall.",f
"If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes
she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring
an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.",f
"The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly
forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,
charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the
room.",f
"“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”

She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my
hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was
no one in the world she so much wanted to see.",f
"That was a way she
had.",f
"She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
Baker.",f
"(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people
lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less
charming.)",f
"At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object
she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her
something of a fright.",f
Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.,f
"Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned
tribute from me.",f
"I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
thrilling voice.",f
"It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and
down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be
played again.",f
"Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement
in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:
a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had
done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
exciting things hovering in the next hour.",f
"I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,
and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.",f
“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.,f
“The whole town is desolate.,f
"All the cars have the left rear wheel
painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all
night along the north shore.”

“How gorgeous!",f
"Let’s go back, Tom.",f
"Tomorrow!” Then she added
irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”

“I’d like to.”

“She’s asleep.",f
She’s three years old.,f
"Haven’t you ever seen her?”

“Never.”

“Well, you ought to see her.",f
"She’s—”

Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped
and rested his hand on my shoulder.",f
"“What you doing, Nick?”

“I’m a bond man.”

“Who with?”

I told him.",f
"“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.",f
This annoyed me.,f
"“You will,” I answered shortly.",f
"“You will if you stay in the East.”

“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at
Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something
more.",f
"“I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”

At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that
I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the
room.",f
"Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned
and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",f
"“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long
as I can remember.”

“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to
New York all afternoon.”

“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the
pantry.",f
"“I’m absolutely in training.”

Her host looked at her incredulously.",f
"“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom
of a glass.",f
"“How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”

I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I
enjoyed looking at her.",f
"She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with
an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward
at the shoulders like a young cadet.",f
"Her grey sun-strained eyes looked
back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,
discontented face.",f
"It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
picture of her, somewhere before.",f
"“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously.",f
"“I know somebody
there.”

“I don’t know a single—”

“You must know Gatsby.”

“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.",f
"“What Gatsby?”

Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;
wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled
me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.",f
"Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward
the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the
diminished wind.",f
"“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning.",f
"She snapped them out with her
fingers.",f
"“In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She
looked at us all radiantly.",f
"“Do you always watch for the longest day
of the year and then miss it?",f
"I always watch for the longest day in
the year and then miss it.”

“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the
table as if she were getting into bed.",f
"“All right,” said Daisy.",f
"“What’ll we plan?” She turned to me
helplessly: “What do people plan?”

Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her
little finger.",f
"“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”

We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.",f
"“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly.",f
"“I know you didn’t mean to,
but you did do it.",f
"That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a
great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”

“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in
kidding.”

“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.",f
"Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool
as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all
desire.",f
"They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a
polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.",f
"They knew
that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too
would be over and casually put away.",f
"It was sharply different from the
West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its
close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer
nervous dread of the moment itself.",f
"“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass
of corky but rather impressive claret.",f
"“Can’t you talk about crops or
something?”

I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in
an unexpected way.",f
"“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently.",f
"“I’ve
gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.",f
"Have you read The Rise
of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”

“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.",f
"“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.",f
"The idea is
if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly
submerged.",f
"It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”

“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of
unthoughtful sadness.",f
"“He reads deep books with long words in
them.",f
"What was that word we—”

“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her
impatiently.",f
“This fellow has worked out the whole thing.,f
"It’s up to
us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will
have control of things.”

“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
toward the fervent sun.",f
"“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom
interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.",f
“This idea is that we’re Nordics.,f
"I am, and you are, and you are,
and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
slight nod, and she winked at me again.",f
"“—And we’ve produced all the
things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all
that.",f
"Do you see?”

There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his
complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.",f
"When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler
left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned
towards me.",f
"“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.",f
“It’s about the butler’s nose.,f
"Do you want to hear about the butler’s
nose?”

“That’s why I came over tonight.”

“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher
for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred
people.",f
"He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it
began to affect his nose—”

“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.",f
“Yes.,f
"Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up
his position.”

For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I
listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering
regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.",f
"The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,
whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went
inside.",f
"As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned
forward again, her voice glowing and singing.",f
"“I love to see you at my table, Nick.",f
"You remind me of a—of a rose, an
absolute rose.",f
"Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:
“An absolute rose?”

This was untrue.",f
I am not even faintly like a rose.,f
"She was only
extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart
was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,
thrilling words.",f
"Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and
excused herself and went into the house.",f
"Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of
meaning.",f
"I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”
in a warning voice.",f
"A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the
room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to
hear.",f
"The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,
mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.",f
“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.,f
“Don’t talk.,f
"I want to hear what happens.”

“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.",f
"“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.",f
"“I thought everybody knew.”

“I don’t.”

“Why—” she said hesitantly.",f
"“Tom’s got some woman in New York.”

“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.",f
Miss Baker nodded.,f
“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.,f
"Don’t you think?”

Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a
dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at
the table.",f
“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.,f
"She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and
continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic
outdoors.",f
"There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a
nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.",f
"He’s singing
away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”

“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light
enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”

The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head
decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,
vanished into air.",f
"Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes
at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I
was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to
avoid all eyes.",f
"I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but
I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain
hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill
metallic urgency out of mind.",f
"To a certain temperament the situation
might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone
immediately for the police.",f
"The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.",f
"Tom and Miss
Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into
the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,
trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed
Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.",f
"In
its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.",f
"Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and
her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.",f
"I saw that
turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be
some sedative questions about her little girl.",f
"“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly.",f
"“Even
if we are cousins.",f
"You didn’t come to my wedding.”

“I wasn’t back from the war.”

“That’s true.” She hesitated.",f
"“Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,
and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”

Evidently she had reason to be.",f
"I waited but she didn’t say any more,
and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her
daughter.",f
"“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”

“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently.",f
"“Listen, Nick; let me tell you
what I said when she was born.",f
﻿CHAPTER 1.,f
"Amory, Son of Beatrice


Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the
stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while.",f
"His father, an
ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of
drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty
through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and
in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor
and met Beatrice O'Hara.",f
"In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to
posterity his height of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at
crucial moments, these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory.",f
"For many years he hovered in the background of his family's life, an
unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless, silky hair,
continually occupied in ""taking care"" of his wife, continually harassed
by the idea that he didn't and couldn't understand her.",f
But Beatrice Blaine!,f
There was a woman!,f
"Early pictures taken on her
father's estate at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, or in Rome at the Sacred
Heart Convent--an educational extravagance that in her youth was only
for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy--showed the exquisite
delicacy of her features, the consummate art and simplicity of her
clothes.",f
"A brilliant education she had--her youth passed in renaissance
glory, she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families;
known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori
and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had
some culture even to have heard of.",f
"She learned in England to prefer
whiskey and soda to wine, and her small talk was broadened in two senses
during a winter in Vienna.",f
"All in all Beatrice O'Hara absorbed the
sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again; a tutelage
measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of
and charming about; a culture rich in all arts and traditions, barren of
all ideas, in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the
inferior roses to produce one perfect bud.",f
"In her less important moments she returned to America, met Stephen
Blaine and married him--this almost entirely because she was a little
bit weary, a little bit sad.",f
"Her only child was carried through
a tiresome season and brought into the world on a spring day in
ninety-six.",f
When Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for her.,f
"He
was an auburn-haired boy, with great, handsome eyes which he would grow
up to in time, a facile imaginative mind and a taste for fancy dress.",f
"From his fourth to his tenth year he did the country with his mother
in her father's private car, from Coronado, where his mother became so
bored that she had a nervous breakdown in a fashionable hotel, down to
Mexico City, where she took a mild, almost epidemic consumption.",f
"This
trouble pleased her, and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part
of her atmosphere--especially after several astounding bracers.",f
"So, while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying
governesses on the beach at Newport, or being spanked or tutored or read
to from ""Do and Dare,"" or ""Frank on the Mississippi,"" Amory was biting
acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf, outgrowing a natural repugnance
to chamber music and symphonies, and deriving a highly specialized
education from his mother.",f
"""Amory.""",f
"""Yes, Beatrice.""",f
(Such a quaint name for his mother; she encouraged it.),f
"""Dear, don't _think_ of getting out of bed yet.",f
"I've always suspected
that early rising in early life makes one nervous.",f
"Clothilde is having
your breakfast brought up.""",f
"""All right.""",f
"""I am feeling very old to-day, Amory,"" she would sigh, her face a rare
cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands as facile
as Bernhardt's.",f
"""My nerves are on edge--on edge.",f
"We must leave this
terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for sunshine.""",f
"Amory's penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled hair at
his mother.",f
Even at this age he had no illusions about her.,f
"""Amory.""",f
"""Oh, _yes_.""",f
"""I want you to take a red-hot bath as hot as you can bear it, and just
relax your nerves.",f
"You can read in the tub if you wish.""",f
"She fed him sections of the ""Fetes Galantes"" before he was ten; at
eleven he could talk glibly, if rather reminiscently, of Brahms and
Mozart and Beethoven.",f
"One afternoon, when left alone in the hotel at
Hot Springs, he sampled his mother's apricot cordial, and as the taste
pleased him, he became quite tipsy.",f
"This was fun for a while, but
he essayed a cigarette in his exaltation, and succumbed to a vulgar,
plebeian reaction.",f
"Though this incident horrified Beatrice, it also
secretly amused her and became part of what in a later generation would
have been termed her ""line.""",f
"""This son of mine,"" he heard her tell a room full of awestruck, admiring
women one day, ""is entirely sophisticated and quite charming--but
delicate--we're all delicate; _here_, you know.""",f
"Her hand was radiantly
outlined against her beautiful bosom; then sinking her voice to a
whisper, she told them of the apricot cordial.",f
"They rejoiced, for she
was a brave raconteuse, but many were the keys turned in sideboard locks
that night against the possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara....",f
"These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state; two maids, the
private car, or Mr. Blaine when available, and very often a physician.",f
"When Amory had the whooping-cough four disgusted specialists glared at
each other hunched around his bed; when he took scarlet fever the number
of attendants, including physicians and nurses, totalled fourteen.",f
"However, blood being thicker than broth, he was pulled through.",f
The Blaines were attached to no city.,f
"They were the Blaines of Lake
Geneva; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of friends,
and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod.",f
"But Beatrice grew
more and more prone to like only new acquaintances, as there were
certain stories, such as the history of her constitution and its many
amendments, memories of her years abroad, that it was necessary for
her to repeat at regular intervals.",f
"Like Freudian dreams, they must be
thrown off, else they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves.",f
"But
Beatrice was critical about American women, especially the floating
population of ex-Westerners.",f
"""They have accents, my dear,"" she told Amory, ""not Southern accents
or Boston accents, not an accent attached to any locality, just an
accent""--she became dreamy.",f
"""They pick up old, moth-eaten London accents
that are down on their luck and have to be used by some one.",f
"They talk
as an English butler might after several years in a Chicago grand-opera
company.""",f
"She became almost incoherent--""Suppose--time in every Western
woman's life--she feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to
have--accent--they try to impress _me_, my dear--""

Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties, she considered
her soul quite as ill, and therefore important in her life.",f
"She had
once been a Catholic, but discovering that priests were infinitely more
attentive when she was in process of losing or regaining faith in Mother
Church, she maintained an enchantingly wavering attitude.",f
"Often she
deplored the bourgeois quality of the American Catholic clergy, and was
quite sure that had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental
cathedrals her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of
Rome.",f
"Still, next to doctors, priests were her favorite sport.",f
"""Ah, Bishop Wiston,"" she would declare, ""I do not want to talk of
myself.",f
"I can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering at your
doors, beseeching you to be simpatico""--then after an interlude filled
by the clergyman--""but my mood--is--oddly dissimilar.""",f
Only to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance.,f
"When she
had first returned to her country there had been a pagan, Swinburnian
young man in Asheville, for whose passionate kisses and unsentimental
conversations she had taken a decided penchant--they had discussed
the matter pro and con with an intellectual romancing quite devoid of
sappiness.",f
"Eventually she had decided to marry for background, and the
young pagan from Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis, joined
the Catholic Church, and was now--Monsignor Darcy.",f
"""Indeed, Mrs. Blaine, he is still delightful company--quite the
cardinal's right-hand man.""",f
"""Amory will go to him one day, I know,"" breathed the beautiful lady,
""and Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood me.""",f
"Amory became thirteen, rather tall and slender, and more than ever on to
his Celtic mother.",f
"He had tutored occasionally--the idea being that he
was to ""keep up,"" at each place ""taking up the work where he left off,""
yet as no tutor ever found the place he left off, his mind was still in
very good shape.",f
"What a few more years of this life would have made of
him is problematical.",f
"However, four hours out from land, Italy bound,
with Beatrice, his appendix burst, probably from too many meals in bed,
and after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America, to the
amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around and
returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier.",f
"You will admit that
if it was not life it was magnificent.",f
"After the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a
suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens, and Amory was left in
Minneapolis, destined to spend the ensuing two years with his aunt and
uncle.",f
"There the crude, vulgar air of Western civilization first catches
him--in his underwear, so to speak.",f
"*****

A KISS FOR AMORY

His lip curled when he read it.",f
"""I am going to have a bobbing party,"" it said, ""on Thursday,
  December the seventeenth, at five o'clock, and I would like it
  very much if you could come.",f
"Yours truly,

  R.S.V.P.",f
Myra St. Claire.,f
"He had been two months in Minneapolis, and his chief struggle had been
the concealing from ""the other guys at school"" how particularly superior
he felt himself to be, yet this conviction was built upon shifting
sands.",f
"He had shown off one day in French class (he was in senior French
class) to the utter confusion of Mr. Reardon, whose accent Amory damned
contemptuously, and to the delight of the class.",f
"Mr. Reardon, who had
spent several weeks in Paris ten years before, took his revenge on the
verbs, whenever he had his book open.",f
"But another time Amory showed off
in history class, with quite disastrous results, for the boys there
were his own age, and they shrilled innuendoes at each other all the
following week:

""Aw--I b'lieve, doncherknow, the Umuricun revolution was _lawgely_ an
affair of the middul _clawses_,"" or

""Washington came of very good blood--aw, quite good--I b'lieve.""",f
Amory ingeniously tried to retrieve himself by blundering on purpose.,f
"Two years before he had commenced a history of the United States which,
though it only got as far as the Colonial Wars, had been pronounced by
his mother completely enchanting.",f
"His chief disadvantage lay in athletics, but as soon as he discovered
that it was the touchstone of power and popularity at school, he began
to make furious, persistent efforts to excel in the winter sports, and
with his ankles aching and bending in spite of his efforts, he skated
valiantly around the Lorelie rink every afternoon, wondering how soon
he would be able to carry a hockey-stick without getting it inexplicably
tangled in his skates.",f
"The invitation to Miss Myra St. Claire's bobbing party spent the morning
in his coat pocket, where it had an intense physical affair with a dusty
piece of peanut brittle.",f
"During the afternoon he brought it to light
with a sigh, and after some consideration and a preliminary draft in the
back of Collar and Daniel's ""First-Year Latin,"" composed an answer:

  My dear Miss St. Claire:
  Your truly charming envitation for the evening of next Thursday
  evening was truly delightful to receive this morning.",f
"I will be
  charm and inchanted indeed to present my compliments on next
  Thursday evening.",f
"Faithfully,

                                          Amory Blaine.",f
"*****

On Thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery,
shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of Myra's house, on the
half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother would
have favored.",f
"He waited on the door-step with his eyes nonchalantly
half-closed, and planned his entrance with precision.",f
"He would cross
the floor, not too hastily, to Mrs. St. Claire, and say with exactly the
correct modulation:

""My _dear_ Mrs. St. Claire, I'm _frightfully_ sorry to be late, but my
maid""--he paused there and realized he would be quoting--""but my uncle
and I had to see a fella--Yes, I've met your enchanting daughter at
dancing-school.""",f
"Then he would shake hands, using that slight, half-foreign bow, with all
the starchy little females, and nod to the fellas who would be standing
'round, paralyzed into rigid groups for mutual protection.",f
A butler (one of the three in Minneapolis) swung open the door.,f
"Amory
stepped inside and divested himself of cap and coat.",f
"He was mildly
surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation from the next
room, and he decided it must be quite formal.",f
"He approved of that--as he
approved of the butler.",f
"""Miss Myra,"" he said.",f
To his surprise the butler grinned horribly.,f
"""Oh, yeah,"" he declared, ""she's here.""",f
"He was unaware that his failure
to be cockney was ruining his standing.",f
Amory considered him coldly.,f
"""But,"" continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily, ""she's the
only one what _is_ here.",f
"The party's gone.""",f
Amory gasped in sudden horror.,f
"""What?""",f
"""She's been waitin' for Amory Blaine.",f
"That's you, ain't it?",f
"Her mother
says that if you showed up by five-thirty you two was to go after 'em in
the Packard.""",f
"Amory's despair was crystallized by the appearance of Myra herself,
bundled to the ears in a polo coat, her face plainly sulky, her voice
pleasant only with difficulty.",f
"""'Lo, Amory.""",f
"""'Lo, Myra.""",f
He had described the state of his vitality.,f
"""Well--you _got_ here, _any_ways.""",f
"""Well--I'll tell you.",f
"I guess you don't know about the auto accident,""
he romanced.",f
Myra's eyes opened wide.,f
"""Who was it to?""",f
"""Well,"" he continued desperately, ""uncle 'n aunt 'n I.""",f
"""Was any one _killed?_""

Amory paused and then nodded.",f
"""Your uncle?""--alarm.",f
"""Oh, no just a horse--a sorta gray horse.""",f
At this point the Erse butler snickered.,f
"""Probably killed the engine,"" he suggested.",f
"Amory would have put him on
the rack without a scruple.",f
"""We'll go now,"" said Myra coolly.",f
"""You see, Amory, the bobs were ordered
for five and everybody was here, so we couldn't wait--""

""Well, I couldn't help it, could I?""",f
"""So mama said for me to wait till ha'past five.",f
"We'll catch the bobs
before it gets to the Minnehaha Club, Amory.""",f
Amory's shredded poise dropped from him.,f
"He pictured the happy party
jingling along snowy streets, the appearance of the limousine, the
horrible public descent of him and Myra before sixty reproachful eyes,
his apology--a real one this time.",f
He sighed aloud.,f
"""What?""",f
inquired Myra.,f
"""Nothing.",f
I was just yawning.,f
"Are we going to _surely_ catch up with 'em
before they get there?""",f
"He was encouraging a faint hope that they might
slip into the Minnehaha Club and meet the others there, be found in
blasé seclusion before the fire and quite regain his lost attitude.",f
"""Oh, sure Mike, we'll catch 'em all right--let's hurry.""",f
He became conscious of his stomach.,f
"As they stepped into the machine he
hurriedly slapped the paint of diplomacy over a rather box-like plan
he had conceived.",f
"It was based upon some ""trade-lasts"" gleaned at
dancing-school, to the effect that he was ""awful good-looking and
_English_, sort of.""",f
"""Myra,"" he said, lowering his voice and choosing his words carefully,
""I beg a thousand pardons.",f
"Can you ever forgive me?""",f
"She regarded
him gravely, his intent green eyes, his mouth, that to her
thirteen-year-old, arrow-collar taste was the quintessence of romance.",f
"Yes, Myra could forgive him very easily.",f
"""Why--yes--sure.""",f
"He looked at her again, and then dropped his eyes.",f
He had lashes.,f
"""I'm awful,"" he said sadly.",f
"""I'm diff'runt.",f
"I don't know why I make faux
pas.",f
"'Cause I don't care, I s'pose.""",f
"Then, recklessly: ""I been smoking
too much.",f
"I've got t'bacca heart.""",f
"Myra pictured an all-night tobacco debauch, with Amory pale and reeling
from the effect of nicotined lungs.",f
She gave a little gasp.,f
"""Oh, _Amory_, don't smoke.",f
"You'll stunt your _growth!_""

""I don't care,"" he persisted gloomily.",f
"""I gotta.",f
I got the habit.,f
"I've
done a lot of things that if my fambly knew""--he hesitated, giving her
imagination time to picture dark horrors--""I went to the burlesque show
last week.""",f
Myra was quite overcome.,f
He turned the green eyes on her again.,f
"""You're
the only girl in town I like much,"" he exclaimed in a rush of sentiment.",f
"""You're simpatico.""",f
"Myra was not sure that she was, but it sounded stylish though vaguely
improper.",f
"Thick dusk had descended outside, and as the limousine made a sudden
turn she was jolted against him; their hands touched.",f
"""You shouldn't smoke, Amory,"" she whispered.",f
"""Don't you know that?""",f
He shook his head.,f
"""Nobody cares.""",f
Myra hesitated.,f
"""_I_ care.""",f
Something stirred within Amory.,f
"""Oh, yes, you do!",f
You got a crush on Froggy Parker.,f
"I guess everybody
knows that.""",f
"""No, I haven't,"" very slowly.",f
"A silence, while Amory thrilled.",f
"There was something fascinating about
Myra, shut away here cosily from the dim, chill air.",f
"Myra, a little
bundle of clothes, with strands of yellow hair curling out from under
her skating cap.",f
"""Because I've got a crush, too--"" He paused, for he heard in the
distance the sound of young laughter, and, peering through the frosted
glass along the lamp-lit street, he made out the dark outline of the
bobbing party.",f
He must act quickly.,f
"He reached over with a violent,
jerky effort, and clutched Myra's hand--her thumb, to be exact.",f
"""Tell him to go to the Minnehaha straight,"" he whispered.",f
"""I wanta talk
to you--I _got_ to talk to you.""",f
"Myra made out the party ahead, had an instant vision of her mother, and

"""Turn down this
side street, Richard, and drive straight to the Minnehaha Club!""",f

cried through the speaking tube.",f
"Amory sank back against the cushions

"""I can kiss her,"" he thought.",f
"""I'll bet I can.",f
"I'll _bet_ I can!""",f
"Overhead the sky was half crystalline, half misty, and the night around
was chill and vibrant with rich tension.",f
"From the Country Club steps the
roads stretched away, dark creases on the white blanket; huge heaps of
snow lining the sides like the tracks of giant moles.",f
"They lingered for
a moment on the steps, and watched the white holiday moon.",f
"""Pale moons like that one""--Amory made a vague gesture--""make people

Reach constantly at something that is near it.",george
—_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.,george
"Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into
relief by poor dress.",george
"Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she
could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the
Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as
her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain
garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the
impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our
elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper.",george
"She was usually
spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her
sister Celia had more common-sense.",george
"Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely
more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress
differed from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its
arrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed
conditions, in most of which her sister shared.",george
"The pride of being
ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not
exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired
backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring
or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a
clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and
managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
respectable family estate.",george
"Young women of such birth, living in a quiet
country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a
parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s
daughter.",george
"Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made
show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was
required for expenses more distinctive of rank.",george
"Such reasons would have
been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious
feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have
determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s
sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to
accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation.",george
"Dorothea
knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;
and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,
made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for
Bedlam.",george
"She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life
involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and
artificial protrusions of drapery.",george
"Her mind was theoretic, and yearned
by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might
frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;
she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,
to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a
quarter where she had not sought it.",george
"Certainly such elements in the
character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and
hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,
vanity, and merely canine affection.",george
"With all this, she, the elder of
the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since
they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans
at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and
afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and
guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their
orphaned condition.",george
"It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with
their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous
opinions, and uncertain vote.",george
"He had travelled in his younger years,
and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too
rambling habit of mind.",george
"Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to
predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with
benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as
possible in carrying them out.",george
"For the most glutinously indefinite
minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax
about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,
concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.",george
"In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in
abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and
virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his
way of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the
more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of
money for generous schemes.",george
"She was regarded as an heiress; for not
only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but
if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s
estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which
seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late
conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and
of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities
of genteel life.",george
"And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such
prospects?",george
"Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her
insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a
wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead
her at last to refuse all offers.",george
"A young lady of some birth and
fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick
laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the
time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,
and of sitting up at night to read old theological books!",george
"Such a wife
might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the
application of her income which would interfere with political economy
and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice
before he risked himself in such fellowship.",george
"Women were expected to
have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic
life was, that opinions were not acted on.",george
"Sane people did what their
neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know
and avoid them.",george
"The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,
was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and
innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her
religion, too unusual and striking.",george
Poor Dorothea!,george
"compared with her,
the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much
subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of
blazonry or clock-face for it.",george
"Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by
this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably
reconcilable with it.",george
"Most men thought her bewitching when she was on
horseback.",george
"She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the
country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she
looked very little like a devotee.",george
"Riding was an indulgence which she
allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she
enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to
renouncing it.",george
"She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it
was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with
attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman
appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of
seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:
Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from
Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for
Celia to accept him.",george
"That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself
would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance.",george
"Dorothea, with all
her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas
about marriage.",george
"She felt sure that she would have accepted the
judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that
wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his
blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits
it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome
baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed
uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover?",george
"The really delightful
marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and
could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.",george
"These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all
the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some
middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces.",george
"But he himself
dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for
such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s
objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is
to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of
gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire.",george
"So
Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all
dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.",george
"Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another
gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt
some venerating expectation.",george
"This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,
noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many
years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also
as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views
of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication
of his book.",george
"His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be
measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.",george
"Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she
had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the
pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on
finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted
in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to
propose something, said—

“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we
looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them?",george
"It is exactly six
months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at
them yet.”

Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full
presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and
principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious
electricity if you touched them incautiously.",george
"To her relief, Dorothea’s
eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.",george
"“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia!",george
"Is it six calendar or
six lunar months?”

“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April
when uncle gave them to you.",george
"You know, he said that he had forgotten
them till then.",george
"I believe you have never thought of them since you
locked them up in the cabinet here.”

“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a
full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory.",george
"She had her pencil
in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.",george
"Celia colored, and looked very grave.",george
"“I think, dear, we are wanting in
respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.",george
"And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of
mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who
was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.",george
"And Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore
jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really
applied herself to argument.",george
"“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished
discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she
had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments.",george
"“Of
course, then, let us have them out.",george
Why did you not tell me before?,george
"But
the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her
head and seemed to despair of her memory.",george
"“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long
meditated and prearranged.",george
"“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”

The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread
out, making a bright parterre on the table.",george
"It was no great collection,
but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest
that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in
exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.",george
"Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her
sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the
circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and
she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.",george
"“There, Celia!",george
you can wear that with your Indian muslin.,george
"But this
cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”

Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure.",george
"“O Dodo, you must keep the
cross yourself.”

“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless
deprecation.",george
"“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”
said Celia, insistingly.",george
"“You _might_ wear that.”

“Not for the world, not for the world.",george
"A cross is the last thing I
would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.",george
"“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.",george
"“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek.",george
"“Souls have
complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”

“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”

“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so
fond of—plenty of things.",george
"In fact, they are all yours, dear.",george
"We need
discuss them no longer.",george
"There—take away your property.”

Celia felt a little hurt.",george
"There was a strong assumption of superiority
in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of
an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.",george
"“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will
never wear them?”

“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to
keep you in countenance.",george
"If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I
should feel as if I had been pirouetting.",george
"The world would go round with
me, and I should not know how to walk.”

Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off.",george
"“It would be a
little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit
you better,” she said, with some satisfaction.",george
"The complete unfitness
of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia
happier in taking it.",george
"She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed
a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a
cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.",george
"“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current
of feeling, as sudden as the gleam.",george
"“It is strange how deeply colors
seem to penetrate one, like scent.",george
"I suppose that is the reason why
gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John.",george
"They
look like fragments of heaven.",george
"I think that emerald is more beautiful
than any of them.”

“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia.",george
"“We did not notice
this at first.”

“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her
finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on
a level with her eyes.",george
"All the while her thought was trying to justify
her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.",george
"“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,
beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,
and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than
purple amethysts.",george
"“You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing
else.",george
"But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”

“Yes!",george
"I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea.",george
"Then,
letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what
miserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She
paused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce
the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.",george
"“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly.",george
"“But take all
the rest away, and the casket.”

She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking
at them.",george
"She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at
these little fountains of pure color.",george
"“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with
real curiosity as to what she would do.",george
Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister.,george
"Across all her imaginative
adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen
discernment, which was not without a scorching quality.",george
"If Miss Brooke
ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward
fire.",george
"“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily.",george
"“I cannot tell to what level I
may sink.”

Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her
sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the
ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away.",george
"Dorothea
too was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the
purity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with
that little explosion.",george
"Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the
wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked
that question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was
inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the
jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them
altogether.",george
"“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a
necklace will not interfere with my prayers.",george
"And I do not see that I
should be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,
though of course she herself ought to be bound by them.",george
"But Dorothea is
not always consistent.”

Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her
sister calling her.",george
"“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great
architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”

As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her
sister’s arm caressingly.",george
Celia understood the action.,george
"Dorothea saw
that she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her.",george
"Since they
could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the
attitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister.",george
"The younger had
always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private
opinions?",george
CHAPTER II.,george
"“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un
caballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo
que veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un
as no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que
relumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don
Quijote.”—CERVANTES.",george
"“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray
steed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is
nothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something
shiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that
resplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”


“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling
way, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s
Agricultural Chemistry.",george
"“Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him
years ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet
Wordsworth, you know.",george
Now there was something singular.,george
"I was at
Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined
with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s.",george
"There’s an oddity in
things, now.",george
But Davy was there: he was a poet too.,george
"Or, as I may say,
Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two.",george
"That was true in every
sense, you know.”

Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual.",george
"In the beginning of
dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the
mass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably.",george
"She wondered how a man
like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality.",george
"His manners, she
thought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his
deep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke.",george
"He had the
spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different
as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type
represented by Sir James Chettam.",george
"“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,
“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see
if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among
my tenants.",george
"Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”

“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into
electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of
your cow-house.",george
It won’t do.,george
"I went into science a great deal myself at
one time; but I saw it would not do.",george
"It leads to everything; you can
let nothing alone.",george
"No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,
and that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know.",george
"But
your fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you
can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”

“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out
how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in
keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it.",george
"It is not a sin to make
yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”

She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir
James had appealed to her.",george
"He was accustomed to do so, and she had
often thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was
her brother-in-law.",george
"Mr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was
speaking, and seemed to observe her newly.",george
"“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon.",george
"“I remember when we were all
reading Adam Smith.",george
"_There_ is a book, now.",george
"I took in all the new ideas
at one time—human perfectibility, now.",george
"But some say, history moves in
circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself.",george
"The
fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in
fact.",george
It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.,george
I pulled up; I pulled up in time.,george
But not too hard.,george
"I have always been
in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be
landed back in the dark ages.",george
"But talking of books, there is Southey’s
‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning.",george
"You know Southey?”

“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous
reason, and thinking of the book only.",george
"“I have little leisure for such
literature just now.",george
"I have been using up my eyesight on old characters
lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am
fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect
reader.",george
"It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the
inward sources; I live too much with the dead.",george
"My mind is something
like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying
mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and
confusing changes.",george
"But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution
about my eyesight.”

This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length.",george
"He
delivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make
a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,
occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more
conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy
slovenliness.",george
"Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most
interesting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,
the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the
Waldenses.",george
"To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the
highest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to
assist in, though only as a lamp-holder!",george
"This elevating thought lifted
her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of
political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an
extinguisher over all her lights.",george
"“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an
opportunity of saying.",george
"“I should have thought you would enter a little
into the pleasures of hunting.",george
"I wish you would let me send over a
chestnut horse for you to try.",george
It has been trained for a lady.,george
"I saw
you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you.",george
"My
groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention
the time.”

“Thank you, you are very good.",george
I mean to give up riding.,george
"I shall not
ride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a
little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when
she wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.",george
"“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that
showed strong interest.",george
"“Your sister is given to self-mortification, is
she not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.",george
"“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say
something that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as
possible above her necklace.",george
"“She likes giving up.”

“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not
self-mortification.",george
"But there may be good reasons for choosing not to
do what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.",george
"Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.
Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.",george
"“Exactly,” said Sir James.",george
"“You give up from some high, generous
motive.”

“No, indeed, not exactly.",george
"I did not say that of myself,” answered
Dorothea, reddening.",george
"Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from
high delight or anger.",george
"At this moment she felt angry with the perverse
Sir James.",george
"Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to
listen to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of
allowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then
informing him that the Reformation either meant something or it did
not, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism
was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist
chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly
speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.",george
"“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if
to explain the insight just manifested.",george
"“I know something of all
schools.",george
I knew Wilberforce in his best days.,george
"Do you know Wilberforce?”

Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”

“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went
into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the
independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”

Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.",george
"“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents.",george
"I
began a long while ago to collect documents.",george
"They want arranging, but
when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an
answer.",george
I have documents at my back.,george
"But now, how do you arrange your
documents?”

“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air
of effort.",george
"“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do.",george
"I have tried pigeon-holes, but
everything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is
in A or Z.”

“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said
Dorothea.",george
"“I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects
under each letter.”

Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have
an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”

“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies
meddle with my documents.",george
"Young ladies are too flighty.”

Dorothea felt hurt.",george
"Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some
special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in
his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other
fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.",george
"When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—

“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”

“Celia!",george
He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw.,george
"He
is remarkably like the portrait of Locke.",george
"He has the same deep
eye-sockets.”

“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”

“Oh, I dare say!",george

"In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the
farmhouses—and even great ladies, clothed in silk and thread-lace, had
their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak—there might be seen in
districts far away among the lanes, or deep in the bosom of the hills,
certain pallid undersized men, who, by the side of the brawny
country-folk, looked like the remnants of a disinherited race.",george
"The
shepherd’s dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men
appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what
dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag?—and these pale men rarely
stirred abroad without that mysterious burden.",george
"The shepherd himself,
though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but
flaxen thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that
thread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving, indispensable
though it was, could be carried on entirely without the help of the
Evil One.",george
"In that far-off time superstition clung easily round every
person or thing that was at all unwonted, or even intermittent and
occasional merely, like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder.",george
"No one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin; and
how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who
knew his father and mother?",george
"To the peasants of old times, the world
outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and
mystery: to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a
conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back
with the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts,
hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust, which would
have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on
his part had ended in the commission of a crime; especially if he had
any reputation for knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft.",george
"All
cleverness, whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the
tongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in itself
suspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible manner, were mostly
not overwise or clever—at least, not beyond such a matter as knowing
the signs of the weather; and the process by which rapidity and
dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they
partook of the nature of conjuring.",george
"In this way it came to pass that
those scattered linen-weavers—emigrants from the town into the
country—were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours,
and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of
loneliness.",george
"In the early years of this century, such a linen-weaver, named Silas
Marner, worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the
nutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe, and not far from the edge
of a deserted stone-pit.",george
"The questionable sound of Silas’s loom, so
unlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine, or the
simpler rhythm of the flail, had a half-fearful fascination for the
Raveloe boys, who would often leave off their nutting or birds’-nesting
to peep in at the window of the stone cottage, counterbalancing a
certain awe at the mysterious action of the loom, by a pleasant sense
of scornful superiority, drawn from the mockery of its alternating
noises, along with the bent, tread-mill attitude of the weaver.",george
"But
sometimes it happened that Marner, pausing to adjust an irregularity in
his thread, became aware of the small scoundrels, and, though chary of
his time, he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from
his loom, and, opening the door, would fix on them a gaze that was
always enough to make them take to their legs in terror.",george
"For how was it
possible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in Silas
Marner’s pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not
close to them, and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart
cramp, or rickets, or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the
rear?",george
"They had, perhaps, heard their fathers and mothers hint that
Silas Marner could cure folks’ rheumatism if he had a mind, and add,
still more darkly, that if you could only speak the devil fair enough,
he might save you the cost of the doctor.",george
"Such strange lingering echoes
of the old demon-worship might perhaps even now be caught by the
diligent listener among the grey-haired peasantry; for the rude mind
with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity.",george
"A shadowy
conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain
from inflicting harm, is the shape most easily taken by the sense of
the Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by
primitive wants, and to whom a life of hard toil has never been
illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith.",george
"To them pain and
mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and
enjoyment: their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed
desire and hope, but is all overgrown by recollections that are a
perpetual pasture to fear.",george
"“Is there anything you can fancy that you
would like to eat?” I once said to an old labouring man, who was in his
last illness, and who had refused all the food his wife had offered
him.",george
"“No,” he answered, “I’ve never been used to nothing but common
victual, and I can’t eat that.” Experience had bred no fancies in him
that could raise the phantasm of appetite.",george
"And Raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered,
undrowned by new voices.",george
"Not that it was one of those barren parishes
lying on the outskirts of civilization—inhabited by meagre sheep and
thinly-scattered shepherds: on the contrary, it lay in the rich central
plain of what we are pleased to call Merry England, and held farms
which, speaking from a spiritual point of view, paid highly-desirable
tithes.",george
"But it was nestled in a snug well-wooded hollow, quite an
hour’s journey on horseback from any turnpike, where it was never
reached by the vibrations of the coach-horn, or of public opinion.",george
"It
was an important-looking village, with a fine old church and large
churchyard in the heart of it, and two or three large brick-and-stone
homesteads, with well-walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks,
standing close upon the road, and lifting more imposing fronts than the
rectory, which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the
churchyard:—a village which showed at once the summits of its social
life, and told the practised eye that there was no great park and
manor-house in the vicinity, but that there were several chiefs in
Raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease, drawing enough money
from their bad farming, in those war times, to live in a rollicking
fashion, and keep a jolly Christmas, Whitsun, and Easter tide.",george
"It was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe; he
was then simply a pallid young man, with prominent short-sighted brown
eyes, whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of
average culture and experience, but for the villagers near whom he had
come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with
the exceptional nature of his occupation, and his advent from an
unknown region called “North’ard”.",george
"So had his way of life:—he invited
no comer to step across his door-sill, and he never strolled into the
village to drink a pint at the Rainbow, or to gossip at the
wheelwright’s: he sought no man or woman, save for the purposes of his
calling, or in order to supply himself with necessaries; and it was
soon clear to the Raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them
to accept him against her will—quite as if he had heard them declare
that they would never marry a dead man come to life again.",george
"This view of
Marner’s personality was not without another ground than his pale face
and unexampled eyes; for Jem Rodney, the mole-catcher, averred that one
evening as he was returning homeward, he saw Silas Marner leaning
against a stile with a heavy bag on his back, instead of resting the
bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done; and that, on
coming up to him, he saw that Marner’s eyes were set like a dead man’s,
and he spoke to him, and shook him, and his limbs were stiff, and his
hands clutched the bag as if they’d been made of iron; but just as he
had made up his mind that the weaver was dead, he came all right again,
like, as you might say, in the winking of an eye, and said
“Good-night,” and walked off.",george
"All this Jem swore he had seen, more by
token that it was the very day he had been mole-catching on Squire
Cass’s land, down by the old saw-pit.",george
"Some said Marner must have been
in a “fit,” a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible;
but the argumentative Mr. Macey, clerk of the parish, shook his head,
and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall
down.",george
"A fit was a stroke, wasn’t it?",george
"and it was in the nature of a
stroke to partly take away the use of a man’s limbs and throw him on
the parish, if he’d got no children to look to.",george
"No, no; it was no
stroke that would let a man stand on his legs, like a horse between the
shafts, and then walk off as soon as you can say “Gee!” But there might
be such a thing as a man’s soul being loose from his body, and going
out and in, like a bird out of its nest and back; and that was how
folks got over-wise, for they went to school in this shell-less state
to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn
with their five senses and the parson.",george
"And where did Master Marner get
his knowledge of herbs from—and charms too, if he liked to give them
away?",george
"Jem Rodney’s story was no more than what might have been expected
by anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates, and made her
sleep like a baby, when her heart had been beating enough to burst her
body, for two months and more, while she had been under the doctor’s
care.",george
"He might cure more folks if he would; but he was worth speaking
fair, if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief.",george
"It was partly to this vague fear that Marner was indebted for
protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have
drawn upon him, but still more to the fact that, the old linen-weaver
in the neighbouring parish of Tarley being dead, his handicraft made
him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district,
and even to the more provident cottagers, who had their little stock of
yarn at the year’s end.",george
"Their sense of his usefulness would have
counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a
deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them.",george
"And the years had rolled on without producing any change in the
impressions of the neighbours concerning Marner, except the change from
novelty to habit.",george
"At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just
the same things about Silas Marner as at the beginning: they did not
say them quite so often, but they believed them much more strongly when
they did say them.",george
"There was only one important addition which the
years had brought: it was, that Master Marner had laid by a fine sight
of money somewhere, and that he could buy up “bigger men” than himself.",george
"But while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary, and
his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, Marner’s
inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every
fervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude.",george
"His life, before he came to Raveloe, had been filled with the movement,
the mental activity, and the close fellowship, which, in that day as in
this, marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow
religious sect, where the poorest layman has the chance of
distinguishing himself by gifts of speech, and has, at the very least,
the weight of a silent voter in the government of his community.",george
"Marner
was highly thought of in that little hidden world, known to itself as
the church assembling in Lantern Yard; he was believed to be a young
man of exemplary life and ardent faith; and a peculiar interest had
been centred in him ever since he had fallen, at a prayer-meeting, into
a mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness, which, lasting
for an hour or more, had been mistaken for death.",george
"To have sought a
medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas
himself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful
self-exclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein.",george
"Silas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline; and
though the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the
absence, on his part, of any spiritual vision during his outward
trance, yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was
seen in an accession of light and fervour.",george
"A less truthful man than he
might have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the
form of resurgent memory; a less sane man might have believed in such a
creation; but Silas was both sane and honest, though, as with many
honest and fervent men, culture had not defined any channels for his
sense of mystery, and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of
inquiry and knowledge.",george
"He had inherited from his mother some
acquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparation—a little store
of wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequest—but of late
years he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this
knowledge, believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer,
and that prayer might suffice without herbs; so that the inherited
delight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and
dandelion and coltsfoot, began to wear to him the character of a
temptation.",george
"Among the members of his church there was one young man, a little older
than himself, with whom he had long lived in such close friendship that
it was the custom of their Lantern Yard brethren to call them David and
Jonathan.",george
"The real name of the friend was William Dane, and he, too,
was regarded as a shining instance of youthful piety, though somewhat
given to over-severity towards weaker brethren, and to be so dazzled by
his own light as to hold himself wiser than his teachers.",george
"But whatever
blemishes others might discern in William, to his friend’s mind he was
faultless; for Marner had one of those impressible self-doubting
natures which, at an inexperienced age, admire imperativeness and lean
on contradiction.",george
"The expression of trusting simplicity in Marner’s
face, heightened by that absence of special observation, that
defenceless, deer-like gaze which belongs to large prominent eyes, was
strongly contrasted by the self-complacent suppression of inward
triumph that lurked in the narrow slanting eyes and compressed lips of
William Dane.",george
"One of the most frequent topics of conversation between
the two friends was Assurance of salvation: Silas confessed that he
could never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear, and
listened with longing wonder when William declared that he had
possessed unshaken assurance ever since, in the period of his
conversion, he had dreamed that he saw the words “calling and election
sure” standing by themselves on a white page in the open Bible.",george
"Such
colloquies have occupied many a pair of pale-faced weavers, whose
unnurtured souls have been like young winged things, fluttering
forsaken in the twilight.",george
"It had seemed to the unsuspecting Silas that the friendship had
suffered no chill even from his formation of another attachment of a
closer kind.",george
"For some months he had been engaged to a young
servant-woman, waiting only for a little increase to their mutual
savings in order to their marriage; and it was a great delight to him
that Sarah did not object to William’s occasional presence in their
Sunday interviews.",george
"It was at this point in their history that Silas’s
cataleptic fit occurred during the prayer-meeting; and amidst the
various queries and expressions of interest addressed to him by his
fellow-members, William’s suggestion alone jarred with the general
sympathy towards a brother thus singled out for special dealings.",george
"He
observed that, to him, this trance looked more like a visitation of
Satan than a proof of divine favour, and exhorted his friend to see
that he hid no accursed thing within his soul.",george
"Silas, feeling bound to
accept rebuke and admonition as a brotherly office, felt no resentment,
but only pain, at his friend’s doubts concerning him; and to this was
soon added some anxiety at the perception that Sarah’s manner towards
him began to exhibit a strange fluctuation between an effort at an
increased manifestation of regard and involuntary signs of shrinking
and dislike.",george
"He asked her if she wished to break off their engagement;
but she denied this: their engagement was known to the church, and had
been recognized in the prayer-meetings; it could not be broken off
without strict investigation, and Sarah could render no reason that
would be sanctioned by the feeling of the community.",george
"At this time the
senior deacon was taken dangerously ill, and, being a childless
widower, he was tended night and day by some of the younger brethren or
sisters.",george
"Silas frequently took his turn in the night-watching with
William, the one relieving the other at two in the morning.",george
"The old
man, contrary to expectation, seemed to be on the way to recovery, when
one night Silas, sitting up by his bedside, observed that his usual
audible breathing had ceased.",george
"The candle was burning low, and he had to
lift it to see the patient’s face distinctly.",george
"Examination convinced him
that the deacon was dead—had been dead some time, for the limbs were
rigid.",george
"Silas asked himself if he had been asleep, and looked at the
clock: it was already four in the morning.",george
"How was it that William had
not come?",george
"In much anxiety he went to seek for help, and soon there were
several friends assembled in the house, the minister among them, while
Silas went away to his work, wishing he could have met William to know
the reason of his non-appearance.",george
"But at six o’clock, as he was
thinking of going to seek his friend, William came, and with him the
minister.",george
"They came to summon him to Lantern Yard, to meet the church
members there; and to his inquiry concerning the cause of the summons
the only reply was, “You will hear.” Nothing further was said until
Silas was seated in the vestry, in front of the minister, with the eyes
of those who to him represented God’s people fixed solemnly upon him.",george
"Then the minister, taking out a pocket-knife, showed it to Silas, and
asked him if he knew where he had left that knife?",george
"Silas said, he did
not know that he had left it anywhere out of his own pocket—but he was
trembling at this strange interrogation.",george
"He was then exhorted not to
hide his sin, but to confess and repent.",george
"The knife had been found in
the bureau by the departed deacon’s bedside—found in the place where
the little bag of church money had lain, which the minister himself had
seen the day before.",george
"Some hand had removed that bag; and whose hand
could it be, if not that of the man to whom the knife belonged?",george
"For
some time Silas was mute with astonishment: then he said, “God will
clear me: I know nothing about the knife being there, or the money
being gone.",george
"Search me and my dwelling; you will find nothing but three
pound five of my own savings, which William Dane knows I have had these
six months.” At this William groaned, but the minister said, “The proof
is heavy against you, brother Marner.",george
"The money was taken in the night
last past, and no man was with our departed brother but you, for
William Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness
from going to take his place as usual, and you yourself said that he
had not come; and, moreover, you neglected the dead body.”

“I must have slept,” said Silas.",george
"Then, after a pause, he added, “Or I
must have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me
under, so that the thief must have come and gone while I was not in the
body, but out of the body.",george
"But, I say again, search me and my dwelling,
for I have been nowhere else.”

The search was made, and it ended—in William Dane’s finding the
well-known bag, empty, tucked behind the chest of drawers in Silas’s
chamber!",george
"On this William exhorted his friend to confess, and not to
hide his sin any longer.",george
"Silas turned a look of keen reproach on him,
and said, “William, for nine years that we have gone in and out
together, have you ever known me tell a lie?",george
"But God will clear me.”

“Brother,” said William, “how do I know what you may have done in the
secret chambers of your heart, to give Satan an advantage over you?”

Silas was still looking at his friend.",george
"Suddenly a deep flush came over
his face, and he was about to speak impetuously, when he seemed checked
again by some inward shock, that sent the flush back and made him
tremble.",george
"But at last he spoke feebly, looking at William.",george
"“I remember now—the knife wasn’t in my pocket.”

William said, “I know nothing of what you mean.” The other persons
present, however, began to inquire where Silas meant to say that the
knife was, but he would give no further explanation: he only said, “I
am sore stricken; I can say nothing.",george
"God will clear me.”

On their return to the vestry there was further deliberation.",george
"Any
resort to legal measures for ascertaining the culprit was contrary to
the principles of the church in Lantern Yard, according to which
prosecution was forbidden to Christians, even had the case held less
scandal to the community.",george
"But the members were bound to take other
measures for finding out the truth, and they resolved on praying and
drawing lots.",george
"This resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those
who are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on
in the alleys of our towns.",george
"Silas knelt with his brethren, relying on
his own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference, but
feeling that there was sorrow and mourning behind for him even
then—that his trust in man had been cruelly bruised.",george
"_The lots declared
that Silas Marner was guilty._ He was solemnly suspended from
church-membership, and called upon to render up the stolen money: only
on confession, as the sign of repentance, could he be received once
more within the folds of the church.",george
Marner listened in silence.,george
"At
last, when everyone rose to depart, he went towards William Dane and
said, in a voice shaken by agitation—

“The last time I remember using my knife, was when I took it out to cut
a strap for you.",george
I don’t remember putting it in my pocket again.,george
"_You_
stole the money, and you have woven a plot to lay the sin at my door.",george
"But you may prosper, for all that: there is no just God that governs
the earth righteously, but a God of lies, that bears witness against
the innocent.”

There was a general shudder at this blasphemy.",george
"William said meekly, “I leave our brethren to judge whether this is the
voice of Satan or not.",george
"I can do nothing but pray for you, Silas.”

Poor Marner went out with that despair in his soul—that shaken trust in
God and man, which is little short of madness to a loving nature.",george
"In
the bitterness of his wounded spirit, he said to himself, “_She_ will
cast me off too.” And he reflected that, if she did not believe the
testimony against him, her whole faith must be upset as his was.",george
"To
people accustomed to reason about the forms in which their religious
feeling has incorporated itself, it is difficult to enter into that
simple, untaught state of mind in which the form and the feeling have
never been severed by an act of reflection.",george
"We are apt to think it
inevitable that a man in Marner’s position should have begun to
question the validity of an appeal to the divine judgment by drawing
lots; but to him this would have been an effort of independent thought
such as he had never known; and he must have made the effort at a
moment when all his energies were turned into the anguish of
disappointed faith.",george
"If there is an angel who records the sorrows of men
as well as their sins, he knows how many and deep are the sorrows that
spring from false ideas for which no man is culpable.",george
"Marner went home, and for a whole day sat alone, stunned by despair,
without any impulse to go to Sarah and attempt to win her belief in his
innocence.",george
"The second day he took refuge from benumbing unbelief, by
getting into his loom and working away as usual; and before many hours
were past, the minister and one of the deacons came to him with the
message from Sarah, that she held her engagement to him at an end.",george
"Silas received the message mutely, and then turned away from the
messengers to work at his loom again.",george
"In little more than a month from
that time, Sarah was married to William Dane; and not long afterwards
it was known to the brethren in Lantern Yard that Silas Marner had
departed from the town.",george
CHAPTER II.,george
"Even people whose lives have been made various by learning, sometimes
find it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life, on
their faith in the Invisible, nay, on the sense that their past joys
and sorrows are a real experience, when they are suddenly transported
to a new land, where the beings around them know nothing of their
history, and share none of their ideas—where their mother earth shows
another lap, and human life has other forms than those on which their
souls have been nourished.",george
"Minds that have been unhinged from their old
faith and love, have perhaps sought this Lethean influence of exile, in
which the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished,
and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories.",george
"But even _their_ experience may hardly enable them thoroughly to
imagine what was the effect on a simple weaver like Silas Marner, when
he left his own country and people and came to settle in Raveloe.",george
"Nothing could be more unlike his native town, set within sight of the
widespread hillsides, than this low, wooded region, where he felt
hidden even from the heavens by the screening trees and hedgerows.",george
"There was nothing here, when he rose in the deep morning quiet and
looked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass, that seemed to
have any relation with that life centring in Lantern Yard, which had
once been to him the altar-place of high dispensations.",george
"The whitewashed
walls; the little pews where well-known figures entered with a subdued
rustling, and where first one well-known voice and then another,
pitched in a peculiar key of petition, uttered phrases at once occult
and familiar, like the amulet worn on the heart; the pulpit where the
minister delivered unquestioned doctrine, and swayed to and fro, and
handled the book in a long accustomed manner; the very pauses between
the couplets of the hymn, as it was given out, and the recurrent swell
of voices in song: these things had been the channel of divine
influences to Marner—they were the fostering home of his religious
emotions—they were Christianity and God’s kingdom upon earth.",george
"A weaver
who finds hard words in his hymn-book knows nothing of abstractions; as
the little child knows nothing of parental love, but only knows one
face and one lap towards which it stretches its arms for refuge and
nurture.",george
"And what could be more unlike that Lantern Yard world than the world in
Raveloe?—orchards looking lazy with neglected plenty; the large church
in the wide churchyard, which men gazed at lounging at their own doors
in service-time; the purple-faced farmers jogging along the lanes or
turning in at the Rainbow; homesteads, where men supped heavily and
slept in the light of the evening hearth, and where women seemed to be
laying up a stock of linen for the life to come.",george
"There were no lips in
Raveloe from which a word could fall that would stir Silas Marner’s
benumbed faith to a sense of pain.",george
"In the early ages of the world, we
know, it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by
its own divinities, so that a man could cross the bordering heights and
be out of the reach of his native gods, whose presence was confined to
the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from
his birth.",george
"And poor Silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike
the feeling of primitive men, when they fled thus, in fear or in
sullenness, from the face of an unpropitious deity.",george
"It seemed to him
that the Power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the
prayer-meetings, was very far away from this land in which he had taken
refuge, where men lived in careless abundance, knowing and needing
nothing of that trust, which, for him, had been turned to bitterness.",george
"The little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly, that
frustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the
blackness of night.",george
"His first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom; and he
went on with this unremittingly, never asking himself why, now he was
come to Raveloe, he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of
Mrs. Osgood’s table-linen sooner than she expected—without
contemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the
work.",george
"He seemed to weave, like the spider, from pure impulse, without
reflection.",george
"Every man’s work, pursued steadily, tends in this way to
become an end in itself, and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of
his life.",george
"Silas’s hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle, and
his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves
under his effort.",george
"Then there were the calls of hunger; and Silas, in
his solitude, had to provide his own breakfast, dinner, and supper, to
fetch his own water from the well, and put his own kettle on the fire;
and all these immediate promptings helped, along with the weaving, to
reduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect.",george
"He
hated the thought of the past; there was nothing that called out his
love and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst; and the
future was all dark, for there was no Unseen Love that cared for him.",george
"Thought was arrested by utter bewilderment, now its old narrow pathway
was closed, and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had
fallen on its keenest nerves.",george
"But at last Mrs. Osgood’s table-linen was finished, and Silas was paid
in gold.",george
"His earnings in his native town, where he worked for a
wholesale dealer, had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly,
and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of
piety and charity.",george
"Now, for the first time in his life, he had five
bright guineas put into his hand; no man expected a share of them, and
he loved no man that he should offer him a share.",george
"But what were the
guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving?",george
"It
was needless for him to ask that, for it was pleasant to him to feel
them in his palm, and look at their bright faces, which were all his
own: it was another element of life, like the weaving and the
satisfaction of hunger, subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief
and love from which he had been cut off.",george
"The weaver’s hand had known
the touch of hard-won money even before the palm had grown to its full
breadth; for twenty years, mysterious money had stood to him as the
symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil.",george
"He had seemed
to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for
him; for he loved the _purpose_ then.",george
"But now, when all purpose was
gone, that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a
sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the
seeds of desire; and as Silas walked homeward across the fields in the
twilight, he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the
gathering gloom.",george
"About this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility
of some fellowship with his neighbours.",george
"One day, taking a pair of shoes
to be mended, he saw the cobbler’s wife seated by the fire, suffering
from the terrible symptoms of heart-disease and dropsy, which he had
witnessed as the precursors of his mother’s death.",george
"He felt a rush of
pity at the mingled sight and remembrance, and, recalling the relief
his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove, he promised
Sally Oates to bring her something that would ease her, since the
doctor did her no good.",george
"In this office of charity, Silas felt, for the
first time since he had come to Raveloe, a sense of unity between his
past and present life, which might have been the beginning of his
rescue from the insect-like existence into which his nature had shrunk.",george
"But Sally Oates’s disease had raised her into a personage of much
interest and importance among the neighbours, and the fact of her
having found relief from drinking Silas Marner’s “stuff” became a
matter of general discourse.",george
"When Doctor Kimble gave physic, it was
natural that it should have an effect; but when a weaver, who came from
nobody knew where, worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters, the
occult character of the process was evident.",george
"Such a sort of thing had
not been known since the Wise Woman at Tarley died; and she had charms
as well as “stuff”: everybody went to her when their children had fits.",george
"Silas Marner must be a person of the same sort, for how did he know
what would bring back Sally Oates’s breath, if he didn’t know a fine
sight more than that?",george
"The Wise Woman had words that she muttered to
herself, so that you couldn’t hear what they were, and if she tied a
bit of red thread round the child’s toe the while, it would keep off
the water in the head.",george
"There were women in Raveloe, at that present
time, who had worn one of the Wise Woman’s little bags round their
necks, and, in consequence, had never had an idiot child, as Ann
Coulter had.",george
"Silas Marner could very likely do as much, and more; and
now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts, and be
so “comical-looking”.",george
"But Sally Oates must mind and not tell the
doctor, for he would be sure to set his face against Marner: he was
always angry about the Wise Woman, and used to threaten those who went
to her that they should have none of his help any more.",george
"Silas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who
wanted him to charm away the whooping-cough, or bring back the milk,
and by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the
hands; and, to secure themselves against a refusal, the applicants
brought silver in their palms.",george
"Silas might have driven a profitable
trade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs; but money on
this condition was no temptation to him: he had never known an impulse
towards falsity, and he drove one after another away with growing
irritation, for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to
Tarley, and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the
sake of asking his aid.",george
"But the hope in his wisdom was at length
changed into dread, for no one believed him when he said he knew no
charms and could work no cures, and every man and woman who had an
accident or a new attack after applying to him, set the misfortune down
to Master Marner’s ill-will and irritated glances.",george
"Thus it came to pass
that his movement of pity towards Sally Oates, which had given him a
transient sense of brotherhood, heightened the repulsion between him
and his neighbours, and made his isolation more complete.",george
"Gradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap,
and Marner drew less and less for his own wants, trying to solve the
problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on
as small an outlay as possible.",george
"Have not men, shut up in solitary
imprisonment, found an interest in marking the moments by straight
strokes of a certain length on the wall, until the growth of the sum of
straight strokes, arranged in triangles, has become a mastering
purpose?",george
"Do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by
repeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition has bred
a want, which is incipient habit?",george
"That will help us to understand how
the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose
imaginations, even in the very beginning of their hoard, showed them no
purpose beyond it.",george
"Marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a
square, and then into a larger square; and every added guinea, while it
was itself a satisfaction, bred a new desire.",george
"In this strange world,
made a hopeless riddle to him, he might, if he had had a less intense
nature, have sat weaving, weaving—looking towards the end of his
pattern, or towards the end of his web, till he forgot the riddle, and
everything else but his immediate sensations; but the money had come to
mark off his weaving into periods, and the money not only grew, but it
remained with him.",george
"He began to think it was conscious of him, as his
loom was, and he would on no account have exchanged those coins, which
had become his familiars, for other coins with unknown faces.",george
"He
handled them, he counted them, till their form and colour were like the
satisfaction of a thirst to him; but it was only in the night, when his
work was done, that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship.",george
"He
had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom, and here he
had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas
and silver coins, covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced
them.",george
"Not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or
strongly to his mind: hoarding was common in country districts in those
days; there were old labourers in the parish of Raveloe who were known
to have their savings by them, probably inside their flock-beds; but
their rustic neighbours, though not all of them as honest as their
ancestors in the days of King Alfred, had not imaginations bold enough
to lay a plan of burglary.",george
"How could they have spent the money in their
own village without betraying themselves?",george
"They would be obliged to “run
away”—a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey.",george
"So, year after year, Silas Marner had lived in this solitude, his
guineas rising in the iron pot, and his life narrowing and hardening
itself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction
that had no relation to any other being.",george
"His life had reduced itself to
the functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an
end towards which the functions tended.",george
"The same sort of process has
perhaps been undergone by wiser men, when they have been cut off from
faith and love—only, instead of a loom and a heap of guineas, they have
had some erudite research, some ingenious project, or some well-knit
theory.",george
"Strangely Marner’s face and figure shrank and bent themselves
into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life, so that
he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube,
which has no meaning standing apart.",george
"The prominent eyes that used to
look trusting and dreamy, now looked as if they had been made to see
only one kind of thing that was very small, like tiny grain, for which
they hunted everywhere: and he was so withered and yellow, that, though
he was not yet forty, the children always called him “Old Master
Marner”.",george
"Yet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened, which
showed that the sap of affection was not all gone.",george
"It was one of his
daily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off, and
for this purpose, ever since he came to Raveloe, he had had a brown
earthenware pot, which he held as his most precious utensil among the
very few conveniences he had granted himself.",george
"It had been his companion
for twelve years, always standing on the same spot, always lending its
handle to him in the early morning, so that its form had an expression
for him of willing helpfulness, and the impress of its handle on his
palm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear
water.",george
"One day as he was returning from the well, he stumbled against
the step of the stile, and his brown pot, falling with force against
the stones that overarched the ditch below him, was broken in three
pieces.",george
"Silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in
his heart.",george
"The brown pot could never be of use to him any more, but he
stuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a
memorial.",george
"This is the history of Silas Marner, until the fifteenth year after he
came to Raveloe.",george
"The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled
with its monotony, his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of
sameness in the brownish web, his muscles moving with such even
repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the
holding of his breath.",george
"But at night came his revelry: at night he
closed his shutters, and made fast his doors, and drew forth his gold.",george
"Long ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to
hold them, and he had made for them two thick leather bags, which
wasted no room in their resting-place, but lent themselves flexibly to
every corner.",george
"How the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the
dark leather mouths!",george
"The silver bore no large proportion in amount to
the gold, because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work
were always partly paid for in gold, and out of the silver he supplied
his own bodily wants, choosing always the shillings and sixpences to
spend in this way.",george
"He loved the guineas best, but he would not change
the silver—the crowns and half-crowns that were his own earnings,
begotten by his labour; he loved them all.",george
"He spread them out in heaps
and bathed his hands in them; then he counted them and set them up in
regular piles, and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and
fingers, and thought fondly of the guineas that were only half-earned
by the work in his loom, as if they had been unborn children—thought of
the guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years, through
all his life, which spread far away before him, the end quite hidden by
countless days of weaving.",george
"No wonder his thoughts were still with his
loom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the
lanes to fetch and carry home his work, so that his steps never
wandered to the hedge-banks and the lane-side in search of the once
familiar herbs: these too belonged to the past, from which his life had
shrunk away, like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy
fringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread, that cuts a
groove for itself in the barren sand.",george
"But about the Christmas of that fifteenth year, a second great change
came over Marner’s life, and his history became blent in a singular
manner with the life of his neighbours.",george
CHAPTER III.,george
"The greatest man in Raveloe was Squire Cass, who lived in the large red
house with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high
stables behind it, nearly opposite the church.",george
"He was only one among
several landed parishioners, but he alone was honoured with the title
of Squire; for though Mr. Osgood’s family was also understood to be of
timeless origin—the Raveloe imagination having never ventured back to
that fearful blank when there were no Osgoods—still, he merely owned
the farm he occupied; whereas Squire Cass had a tenant or two, who
complained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord.",george
"It was still that glorious war-time which was felt to be a peculiar
favour of Providence towards the landed interest, and the fall of
prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen
down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry
were plentifully anointing their wheels.",george
"I am speaking now in relation
to Raveloe and the parishes that resembled it; for our old-fashioned
country life had many different aspects, as all life must have when it
is spread over a various surface, and breathed on variously by
multitudinous currents, from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of
men, which are for ever moving and crossing each other with
incalculable results.",george
"Raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the
rutted lanes, aloof from the currents of industrial energy and Puritan
earnestness: the rich ate and drank freely, accepting gout and apoplexy
as things that ran mysteriously in respectable families, and the poor
thought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly
life; besides, their feasting caused a multiplication of orts, which
were the heirlooms of the poor.",george
"Betty Jay scented the boiling of Squire
Cass’s hams, but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in
which they were boiled; and when the seasons brought round the great
merry-makings, they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the
poor.",george
"For the Raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the
barrels of ale—they were on a large scale, and lasted a good while,
especially in the winter-time.",george
"After ladies had packed up their best
gowns and top-knots in bandboxes, and had incurred the risk of fording
streams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather,
when there was no knowing how high the water would rise, it was not to
be supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure.",george
"On this
ground it was always contrived in the dark seasons, when there was
little work to be done, and the hours were long, that several
neighbours should keep open house in succession.",george
"So soon as Squire
Cass’s standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness, his guests
had nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to Mr.
Osgood’s, at the Orchards, and they found hams and chines uncut,
pork-pies with the scent of the fire in them, spun butter in all its
freshness—everything, in fact, that appetites at leisure could desire,
in perhaps greater perfection, though not in greater abundance, than at
Squire Cass’s.",george
"For the Squire’s wife had died long ago, and the Red House was without
that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome
love and fear in parlour and kitchen; and this helped to account not
only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the
holiday provisions, but also for the frequency with which the proud
Squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the Rainbow rather
than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot; perhaps, also, for the
fact that his sons had turned out rather ill. Raveloe was not a place
where moral censure was severe, but it was thought a weakness in the
Squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness; and though
some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford
it, people shook their heads at the courses of the second son, Dunstan,
commonly called Dunsey Cass, whose taste for swopping and betting might
turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats.",george
"To be sure,
the neighbours said, it was no matter what became of Dunsey—a spiteful
jeering fellow, who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other
people went dry—always provided that his doings did not bring trouble
on a family like Squire Cass’s, with a monument in the church, and
tankards older than King George.",george
"But it would be a thousand pities if
Mr. Godfrey, the eldest, a fine open-faced good-natured young man who
was to come into the land some day, should take to going along the same
road with his brother, as he had seemed to do of late.",george
"If he went on in
that way, he would lose Miss Nancy Lammeter; for it was well known that
she had looked very shyly on him ever since last Whitsuntide
twelvemonth, when there was so much talk about his being away from home
days and days together.",george
"There was something wrong, more than
common—that was quite clear; for Mr. Godfrey didn’t look half so
fresh-coloured and open as he used to do.",george
"At one time everybody was
saying, What a handsome couple he and Miss Nancy Lammeter would make!",george
﻿Chapter I.,george
"Outside Dorlcote Mill

A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green
banks to the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its
passage with an impetuous embrace.",george
"On this mighty tide the black
ships—laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of
oil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal—are borne along to
the town of St Ogg’s, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the
broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the
river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the
transient glance of this February sun.",george
"Far away on each hand stretch
the rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the
seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of
the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn.",george
"There is a remnant still of last
year’s golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the
hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the
distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their
red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash.",george
"Just by
the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current
into the Floss.",george
"How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing
wavelets!",george
"It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along
the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one
who is deaf and loving.",george
I remember those large dipping willows.,george
"I
remember the stone bridge.",george
And this is Dorlcote Mill.,george
"I must stand a minute or two here on the
bridge and look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is far
on in the afternoon.",george
"Even in this leafless time of departing February
it is pleasant to look at,—perhaps the chill, damp season adds a charm
to the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and
chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast.",george
"The stream is
brimful now, and lies high in this little withy plantation, and half
drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house.",george
"As I look
at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder
softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from
under the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy the
white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among
the withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier
world above.",george
"The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy
deafness, which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene.",george
"They
are like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world
beyond.",george
"And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming
home with sacks of grain.",george
"That honest wagoner is thinking of his
dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will
not touch it till he has fed his horses,—the strong, submissive,
meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from
between their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that
awful manner as if they needed that hint!",george
"See how they stretch their
shoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy
because they are so near home.",george
"Look at their grand shaggy feet that
seem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks,
bowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their struggling
haunches!",george
"I should like well to hear them neigh over their
hardly-earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed
from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond.",george
"Now
they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace, and
the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the
trees.",george
"Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting
wheel sending out its diamond jets of water.",george
"That little girl is
watching it too; she has been standing on just the same spot at the
edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge.",george
"And that queer
white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in
ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he is jealous because
his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement.",george
"It is
time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright
fire to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of
the sky.",george
"It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms on the
cold stone of this bridge....

Ah, my arms are really benumbed.",george
"I have been pressing my elbows on the
arms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in
front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years
ago.",george
"Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs
Tulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the
left-hand parlour, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.",george
Chapter II.,george
"Mr Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom

“What I want, you know,” said Mr Tulliver,—“what I want is to give Tom
a good eddication; an eddication as’ll be a bread to him.",george
"That was what
I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at
Lady-day.",george
I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.,george
"The two years at th’ academy ’ud ha’ done well enough, if I’d meant to
make a miller and farmer of him, for he’s had a fine sight more
schoolin’ nor _I_ ever got.",george
"All the learnin’ _my_ father ever paid for
was a bit o’ birch at one end and the alphabet at th’ other.",george
"But I
should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the
tricks o’ these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish.",george
"It ’ud
be a help to me wi’ these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things.",george
"I
wouldn’t make a downright lawyer o’ the lad,—I should be sorry for him
to be a raskill,—but a sort o’ engineer, or a surveyor, or an
auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o’ them smartish businesses
as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain and a high
stool.",george
"They’re pretty nigh all one, and they’re not far off being even
wi’ the law, _I_ believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i’ the face as
hard as one cat looks another.",george
"_He’s_ none frightened at him.”

Mr Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a
fan-shaped cap (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped
caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again.",george
"At that time,
when Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St Ogg’s, and
considered sweet things).",george
"“Well, Mr Tulliver, you know best: _I’ve_ no objections.",george
"But hadn’t I
better kill a couple o’ fowl, and have th’ aunts and uncles to dinner
next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have
got to say about it?",george
"There’s a couple o’ fowl _wants_ killing!”

“You may kill every fowl i’ the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall
ask neither aunt nor uncle what I’m to do wi’ my own lad,” said Mr
Tulliver, defiantly.",george
"“Dear heart!” said Mrs Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric,
“how can you talk so, Mr Tulliver?",george
"But it’s your way to speak
disrespectful o’ my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo’
me, though I’m sure I’m as innocent as the babe unborn.",george
"For nobody’s
ever heard me say as it wasn’t lucky for my children to have aunts and
uncles as can live independent.",george
"Howiver, if Tom’s to go to a new
school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else
he might as well have calico as linen, for they’d be one as yallow as
th’ other before they’d been washed half-a-dozen times.",george
"And then, when
the box is goin’ back’ard and forrard, I could send the lad a cake, or
a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless him!",george
whether they stint him at the meals or no.,george
"My children can eat as much
victuals as most, thank God!”

“Well, well, we won’t send him out o’ reach o’ the carrier’s cart, if
other things fit in,” said Mr Tulliver.",george
"“But you mustn’t put a spoke i’
the wheel about the washin,’ if we can’t get a school near enough.",george
"That’s the fault I have to find wi’ you, Bessy; if you see a stick i’
the road, you’re allays thinkin’ you can’t step over it.",george
"You’d want me
not to hire a good wagoner, ’cause he’d got a mole on his face.”

“Dear heart!” said Mrs Tulliver, in mild surprise, “when did I iver
make objections to a man because he’d got a mole on his face?",george
"I’m sure
I’m rether fond o’ the moles; for my brother, as is dead an’ gone, had
a mole on his brow.",george
"But I can’t remember your iver offering to hire a
wagoner with a mole, Mr Tulliver.",george
"There was John Gibbs hadn’t a mole on
his face no more nor you have, an’ I was all for having you hire _him_;
an’ so you did hire him, an’ if he hadn’t died o’ th’ inflammation, as
we paid Dr Turnbull for attending him, he’d very like ha’ been drivin’
the wagon now.",george
"He might have a mole somewhere out o’ sight, but how was
I to know that, Mr Tulliver?”

“No, no, Bessy; I didn’t mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for
summat else; but niver mind—it’s puzzling work, talking is.",george
"What I’m
thinking on, is how to find the right sort o’ school to send Tom to,
for I might be ta’en in again, as I’ve been wi’ th’ academy.",george
"I’ll have
nothing to do wi’ a ’cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it
sha’n’t be a ’cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their
time i’ summat else besides blacking the family’s shoes, and getting up
the potatoes.",george
"It’s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to
pick.”

Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his
breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there.",george
"Apparently he was not disappointed, for he presently said, “I know what
I’ll do: I’ll talk it over wi’ Riley; he’s coming to-morrow, t’
arbitrate about the dam.”

“Well, Mr Tulliver, I’ve put the sheets out for the best bed, and
Kezia’s got ’em hanging at the fire.",george
"They aren’t the best sheets, but
they’re good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as
for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying ’em, only they’ll
do to lay us out in.",george
"An’ if you was to die to-morrow, Mr Tulliver,
they’re mangled beautiful, an’ all ready, an’ smell o’ lavender as it
’ud be a pleasure to lay ’em out; an’ they lie at the left-hand corner
o’ the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody
to look ’em out but myself.”

As Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of
keys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger
up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire.",george
"If Mr Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he
might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in
anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the
production of the best Holland sheets.",george
"Happily he was not so; he was
only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he
had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his
mention of Mr Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile
examination of his woollen stockings.",george
"“I think I’ve hit it, Bessy,” was his first remark after a short
silence.",george
"“Riley’s as likely a man as any to know o’ some school; he’s
had schooling himself, an’ goes about to all sorts o’ places,
arbitratin’ and vallyin’ and that.",george
"And we shall have time to talk it
over to-morrow night when the business is done.",george
"I want Tom to be such a
sort o’ man as Riley, you know,—as can talk pretty nigh as well as if
it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o’ words as don’t
mean much, so as you can’t lay hold of ’em i’ law; and a good solid
knowledge o’ business too.”

“Well,” said Mrs Tulliver, “so far as talking proper, and knowing
everything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair
up, I shouldn’t mind the lad being brought up to that.",george
"But them
fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts;
they wear a frill till it’s all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I
know Riley does.",george
"And then, if Tom’s to go and live at Mudport, like
Riley, he’ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in,
an’ niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an’ sleep up three pair o’
stairs,—or four, for what I know,—and be burnt to death before he can
get down.”

“No, no,” said Mr Tulliver, “I’ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport:
I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg’s, close by us, an’ live at
home.",george
"But,” continued Mr Tulliver after a pause, “what I’m a bit afraid
on is, as Tom hasn’t got the right sort o’ brains for a smart fellow.",george
"I
doubt he’s a bit slowish.",george
"He takes after your family, Bessy.”

“Yes, that he does,” said Mrs Tulliver, accepting the last proposition
entirely on its own merits; “he’s wonderful for liking a deal o’ salt
in his broth.",george
"That was my brother’s way, and my father’s before him.”

“It seems a bit a pity, though,” said Mr Tulliver, “as the lad should
take after the mother’s side instead o’ the little wench.",george
"That’s the
worst on’t wi’ crossing o’ breeds: you can never justly calkilate
what’ll come on’t.",george
"The little un takes after my side, now: she’s twice
as ’cute as Tom.",george
"Too ’cute for a woman, I’m afraid,” continued Mr
Tulliver, turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the
other.",george
"“It’s no mischief much while she’s a little un; but an
over-’cute woman’s no better nor a long-tailed sheep,—she’ll fetch none
the bigger price for that.”

“Yes, it _is_ a mischief while she’s a little un, Mr Tulliver, for it
runs to naughtiness.",george
"How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours
together passes my cunning.",george
"An’ now you put me i’ mind,” continued Mrs
Tulliver, rising and going to the window, “I don’t know where she is
now, an’ it’s pretty nigh tea-time.",george
"Ah, I thought so,—wanderin’ up an’
down by the water, like a wild thing: She’ll tumble in some day.”

Mrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,—a
process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her
chair.",george
"“You talk o’ ’cuteness, Mr Tulliver,” she observed as she sat down,
“but I’m sure the child’s half an idiot i’ some things; for if I send
her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what she’s gone for, an’
perhaps ’ull sit down on the floor i’ the sunshine an’ plait her hair
an’ sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur’, all the while I’m waiting
for her downstairs.",george
"That niver run i’ my family, thank God!",george
"no more nor
a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter.",george
"I don’t like to fly i’
the face o’ Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one
gell, an’ her so comical.”

“Pooh, nonsense!” said Mr Tulliver; “she’s a straight, black-eyed wench
as anybody need wish to see.",george
"I don’t know i’ what she’s behind other
folks’s children; and she can read almost as well as the parson.”

“But her hair won’t curl all I can do with it, and she’s so franzy
about having it put i’ paper, and I’ve such work as never was to make
her stand and have it pinched with th’ irons.”

“Cut it off—cut it off short,” said the father, rashly.",george
"“How can you talk so, Mr Tulliver?",george
"She’s too big a gell—gone nine, and
tall of her age—to have her hair cut short; an’ there’s her cousin
Lucy’s got a row o’ curls round her head, an’ not a hair out o’ place.",george
"It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I’m
sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does.",george
"Maggie, Maggie,”
continued the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this
small mistake of nature entered the room, “where’s the use o’ my
telling you to keep away from the water?",george
"You’ll tumble in and be
drownded some day, an’ then you’ll be sorry you didn’t do as mother
told you.”

Maggie’s hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her
mother’s accusation.",george
"Mrs Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a
curled crop, “like other folks’s children,” had had it cut too short in
front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight an
hour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly
tossing her head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her gleaming
black eyes,—an action which gave her very much the air of a small
Shetland pony.",george
"“Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin’ of, to throw your
bonnet down there?",george
"Take it upstairs, there’s a good gell, an’ let your
hair be brushed, an’ put your other pinafore on, an’ change your shoes,
do, for shame; an’ come an’ go on with your patchwork, like a little
lady.”

“Oh, mother,” said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, “I don’t _want_
to do my patchwork.”

“What!",george
"not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt
Glegg?”

“It’s foolish work,” said Maggie, with a toss of her mane,—“tearing
things to pieces to sew ’em together again.",george
"And I don’t want to do
anything for my aunt Glegg.",george
"I don’t like her.”

Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr Tulliver
laughs audibly.",george
"“I wonder at you, as you’ll laugh at her, Mr Tulliver,” said the
mother, with feeble fretfulness in her tone.",george
"“You encourage her i’
naughtiness.",george
"An’ her aunts will have it as it’s me spoils her.”

Mrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,—never cried,
when she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and
from the cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted;
in short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability.",george
"But milk
and mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn
only a little sour, they may disagree with young stomachs seriously.",george
"I
have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the
blond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity
undisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little
too old to do without clothing.",george
"I think they must have been given to
feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more
and more ineffectual.",george
Chapter III.,george
"Mr Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom

The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his
brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr
Riley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather highly
educated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to
show a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country acquaintances of
hospitable habits.",george
"Mr Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as
“people of the old school.”

The conversation had come to a pause.",george
"Mr Tulliver, not without a
particular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool
retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem
had had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam
had been settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been
any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they
should be, and Old Harry hadn’t made the lawyers.",george
"Mr Tulliver was, on
the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points
he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several
questionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and
lawyers were created by Old Harry.",george
"Unhappily he had no one to tell him
that this was rampant Manichæism, else he might have seen his error.",george
"But to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this
affair of the water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all
it seemed—look at it one way—as plain as water’s water; but, big a
puzzle as it was, it hadn’t got the better of Riley.",george
"Mr Tulliver took
his brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who
might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker’s,
was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his
friend’s business talents.",george
"But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could
always be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same
condition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr
Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr Riley’s advice.",george
"This was his
particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last
draught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner.",george
"He was not a man
to make an abrupt transition.",george
"This was a puzzling world, as he often
said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an
awkward corner.",george
"Mr Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient.",george
"Why should he
be?",george
"Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his
slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous
brandy-and-water.",george
"“There’s a thing I’ve got i’ my head,” said Mr Tulliver at last, in
rather a lower tone than usual, as he turned his head and looked
steadfastly at his companion.",george
"“Ah!” said Mr Riley, in a tone of mild interest.",george
"He was a man with
heavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same
under all circumstances.",george
"This immovability of face, and the habit of
taking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer, made him trebly
oracular to Mr Tulliver.",george
"“It’s a very particular thing,” he went on; “it’s about my boy Tom.”

At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close
by the fire, with a large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair
back and looked up eagerly.",george
"There were few sounds that roused Maggie
when she was dreaming over her book, but Tom’s name served as well as
the shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with
gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all
events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom.",george
"“You see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,” said Mr
Tulliver; “he’s comin’ away from the ’cademy at Lady-day, an’ I shall
let him run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him to a
downright good school, where they’ll make a scholard of him.”

“Well,” said Mr Riley, “there’s no greater advantage you can give him
than a good education.",george
"Not,” he added, with polite significance,—“not
that a man can’t be an excellent miller and farmer, and a shrewd,
sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the
schoolmaster.”

“I believe you,” said Mr Tulliver, winking, and turning his head on one
side; “but that’s where it is.",george
"I don’t _mean_ Tom to be a miller and
farmer.",george
I see no fun i’ that.,george
"Why, if I made him a miller an’ farmer,
he’d be expectin’ to take to the mill an’ the land, an’ a-hinting at me
as it was time for me to lay by an’ think o’ my latter end.",george
"Nay, nay,
I’ve seen enough o’ that wi’ sons.",george
"I’ll never pull my coat off before I
go to bed.",george
"I shall give Tom an eddication an’ put him to a business, as
he may make a nest for himself, an’ not want to push me out o’ mine.",george
Pretty well if he gets it when I’m dead an’ gone.,george
"I sha’n’t be put off
wi’ spoon-meat afore I’ve lost my teeth.”

This was evidently a point on which Mr Tulliver felt strongly; and the
impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech
showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant
motion of the head from side to side, and an occasional “Nay, nay,”
like a subsiding growl.",george
"These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the
quick.",george
"Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out
of doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by his
wickedness.",george
"This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her
stool, forgetting all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang
within the fender, and going up between her father’s knees, said, in a
half-crying, half-indignant voice,—

“Father, Tom wouldn’t be naughty to you ever; I know he wouldn’t.”

Mrs Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish,
and Mr Tulliver’s heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about
the book.",george
"Mr Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the
father laughed, with a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and
patted his little girl on the back, and then held her hands and kept
her between his knees.",george
“What!,george
"they mustn’t say any harm o’ Tom, eh?” said Mr Tulliver, looking
at Maggie with a twinkling eye.",george
"Then, in a lower voice, turning to Mr
Riley, as though Maggie couldn’t hear, “She understands what one’s
talking about so as never was.",george
"And you should hear her read,—straight
off, as if she knowed it all beforehand.",george
And allays at her book!,george
"But
it’s bad—it’s bad,” Mr Tulliver added sadly, checking this blamable
exultation.",george
"“A woman’s no business wi’ being so clever; it’ll turn to
trouble, I doubt.",george
"But bless you!”—here the exultation was clearly
recovering the mastery,—“she’ll read the books and understand ’em
better nor half the folks as are growed up.”

Maggie’s cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement.",george
"She thought
Mr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he
thought nothing of her before.",george
"Mr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make
nothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently
looked at her, and said,—

“Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some
pictures,—I want to know what they mean.”

Maggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley’s
elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing
back her mane, while she said,—

“Oh, I’ll tell you what that means.",george
"It’s a dreadful picture, isn’t it?",george
But I can’t help looking at it.,george
"That old woman in the water’s a
witch,—they’ve put her in to find out whether she’s a witch or no; and
if she swims she’s a witch, and if she’s drowned—and killed, you
know—she’s innocent, and not a witch, but only a poor silly old woman.",george
"But what good would it do her then, you know, when she was drowned?",george
"Only, I suppose, she’d go to heaven, and God would make it up to her.",george
"And this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo, laughing,—oh, isn’t
he ugly?—I’ll tell you what he is.",george
"He’s the Devil _really_” (here
Maggie’s voice became louder and more emphatic), “and not a right
blacksmith; for the Devil takes the shape of wicked men, and walks
about and sets people doing wicked things, and he’s oftener in the
shape of a bad man than any other, because, you know, if people saw he
was the Devil, and he roared at ’em, they’d run away, and he couldn’t
make ’em do what he pleased.”

Mr Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie’s with petrifying
wonder.",george
"“Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?” he burst out at last.",george
"“‘The History of the Devil,’ by Daniel Defoe,—not quite the right book
for a little girl,” said Mr Riley.",george
"“How came it among your books, Mr
Tulliver?”

Maggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her father said,—

“Why, it’s one o’ the books I bought at Partridge’s sale.",george
"They was all
bound alike,—it’s a good binding, you see,—and I thought they’d be all
good books.",george
There’s Jeremy Taylor’s ‘Holy Living and Dying’ among ’em.,george
"I read in it often of a Sunday” (Mr Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity
with that great writer, because his name was Jeremy); “and there’s a
lot more of ’em,—sermons mostly, I think,—but they’ve all got the same
covers, and I thought they were all o’ one sample, as you may say.",george
"But
it seems one mustn’t judge by th’ outside.",george
"This is a puzzlin’ world.”

“Well,” said Mr Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he patted
Maggie on the head, “I advise you to put by the ‘History of the Devil,’
and read some prettier book.",george
"Have you no prettier books?”

“Oh, yes,” said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to vindicate
the variety of her reading.",george
"“I know the reading in this book isn’t
pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures out
of my own head, you know.",george
"But I’ve got ‘Æsop’s Fables,’ and a book
about Kangaroos and things, and the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress....’”

“Ah, a beautiful book,” said Mr Riley; “you can’t read a better.”

“Well, but there’s a great deal about the Devil in that,” said Maggie,
triumphantly, “and I’ll show you the picture of him in his true shape,
as he fought with Christian.”

Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair,
and reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan,
which opened at once, without the least trouble of search, at the
picture she wanted.",george
"“Here he is,” she said, running back to Mr Riley, “and Tom coloured him
for me with his paints when he was at home last holidays,—the body all
black, you know, and the eyes red, like fire, because he’s all fire
inside, and it shines out at his eyes.”

“Go, go!” said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather
uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a
being powerful enough to create lawyers; “shut up the book, and let’s
hear no more o’ such talk.",george
"It is as I thought—the child ’ull learn more
mischief nor good wi’ the books.",george
"Go, go and see after your mother.”

Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not
being inclined to see after her mother, she compromised the matter by
going into a dark corner behind her father’s chair, and nursing her
doll, toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom’s
absence, neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it
that the waxen cheeks had a wasted, unhealthy appearance.",george
"“Did you ever hear the like on’t?” said Mr Tulliver, as Maggie retired.",george
"“It’s a pity but what she’d been the lad,—she’d ha’ been a match for
the lawyers, _she_ would.",george
"It’s the wonderful’st thing”—here he lowered
his voice—“as I picked the mother because she wasn’t o’er ’cute—bein’ a
good-looking woman too, an’ come of a rare family for managing; but I
picked her from her sisters o’ purpose, ’cause she was a bit weak like;
for I wasn’t agoin’ to be told the rights o’ things by my own fireside.",george
"But you see when a man’s got brains himself, there’s no knowing where
they’ll run to; an’ a pleasant sort o’ soft woman may go on breeding
you stupid lads and ’cute wenches, till it’s like as if the world was
turned topsy-turvy.",george
"It’s an uncommon puzzlin’ thing.”

Mr Riley’s gravity gave way, and he shook a little under the
application of his pinch of snuff before he said,—

“But your lad’s not stupid, is he?",george
"I saw him, when I was here last,
busy making fishing-tackle; he seemed quite up to it.”

“Well, he isn’t not to say stupid,—he’s got a notion o’ things out o’
door, an’ a sort o’ common sense, as he’d lay hold o’ things by the
right handle.",george
"But he’s slow with his tongue, you see, and he reads but
poorly, and can’t abide the books, and spells all wrong, they tell me,
an’ as shy as can be wi’ strangers, an’ you never hear him say ’cute
things like the little wench.",george
"Now, what I want is to send him to a
school where they’ll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen,
and make a smart chap of him.",george
"I want my son to be even wi’ these
fellows as have got the start o’ me with having better schooling.",george
"Not
but what, if the world had been left as God made it, I could ha’ seen
my way, and held my own wi’ the best of ’em; but things have got so
twisted round and wrapped up i’ unreasonable words, as aren’t a bit
like ’em, as I’m clean at fault, often an’ often.",george
"Everything winds
about so—the more straightforrad you are, the more you’re puzzled.”

Mr Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in
a melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a
perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.",george
"“You’re quite in the right of it, Tulliver,” observed Mr Riley.",george
"“Better
spend an extra hundred or two on your son’s education, than leave it
him in your will.",george
"I know I should have tried to do so by a son of mine,
if I’d had one, though, God knows, I haven’t your ready money to play
with, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into the bargain.”

“I dare say, now, you know of a school as ’ud be just the thing for
Tom,” said Mr Tulliver, not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy
with Mr Riley’s deficiency of ready cash.",george
"Mr Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr Tulliver in suspense by a
silence that seemed deliberative, before he said,—

“I know of a very fine chance for any one that’s got the necessary
money and that’s what you have, Tulliver.",george
"The fact is, I wouldn’t
recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school, if he
could afford to do better.",george
"But if any one wanted his boy to get
superior instruction and training, where he would be the companion of
his master, and that master a first rate fellow, I know his man.",george
"I
wouldn’t mention the chance to everybody, because I don’t think
everybody would succeed in getting it, if he were to try; but I mention
it to you, Tulliver, between ourselves.”

The fixed inquiring glance with which Mr Tulliver had been watching his
friend’s oracular face became quite eager.",george
"“Ay, now, let’s hear,” he said, adjusting himself in his chair with the
complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important
communications.",george
"“He’s an Oxford man,” said Mr Riley, sententiously, shutting his mouth
close, and looking at Mr Tulliver to observe the effect of this
stimulating information.",george
“What!,george
"a parson?” said Mr Tulliver, rather doubtfully.",george
"“Yes, and an M.A.",george
"The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him:
why, it was the bishop who got him his present curacy.”

“Ah?” said Mr Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another
concerning these unfamiliar phenomena.",george
"“But what can he want wi’ Tom,
then?”

“Why, the fact is, he’s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his
studies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his
parochial duties.",george
"He’s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to
fill up his time profitably.",george
"The boys would be quite of the family,—the
finest thing in the world for them; under Stelling’s eye continually.”

“But do you think they’d give the poor lad twice o’ pudding?” said Mrs
Tulliver, who was now in her place again.",george
"“He’s such a boy for pudding
as never was; an’ a growing boy like that,—it’s dreadful to think o’
their stintin’ him.”

“And what money ’ud he want?” said Mr Tulliver, whose instinct told him
that the services of this admirable M.A.",george

for Wells’s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty.",james
"How cold
and slimy the water had been!",james
"A fellow had once seen a big rat jump
into the scum.",james
"Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for
Brigid to bring in the tea.",james
"She had her feet on the fender and her
jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell!",james
Dante knew a lot of things.,james
"She had taught him where the Mozambique
Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the
name of the highest mountain in the moon.",james
"Father Arnall knew more than
Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles
said that Dante was a clever woman and a wellread woman.",james
"And when Dante
made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth:
that was heartburn.",james
"A voice cried far out on the playground:

—All in!",james
"Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines:

—All in!",james
All in!,james
"The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them,
glad to go in.",james
Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace.,james
"A fellow
asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering
the fellow.",james
"Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was
looking.",james
"The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said:

—We all know why you speak.",james
You are McGlade’s suck.,james
Suck was a queer word.,james
"The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because
Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect’s false sleeves behind his back
and the prefect used to let on to be angry.",james
But the sound was ugly.,james
"Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and
his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water
went down through the hole in the basin.",james
"And when it had all gone down
slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck.",james
"Only
louder.",james
"To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold
and then hot.",james
"There were two cocks that you turned and water came out:
cold and hot.",james
"He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the
names printed on the cocks.",james
That was a very queer thing.,james
And the air in the corridor chilled him too.,james
It was queer and wettish.,james
"But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like
a little song.",james
"Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in
the playroom you could hear it.",james
It was the hour for sums.,james
"Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board
and then said:

—Now then, who will win?",james
"Go ahead, York!",james
"Go ahead, Lancaster!",james
Stephen tried his best but the sum was too hard and he felt confused.,james
"The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the
breast of his jacket began to flutter.",james
"He was no good at sums but he
tried his best so that York might not lose.",james
"Father Arnall’s face looked
very black but he was not in a wax: he was laughing.",james
"Then Jack Lawton
cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:

—Right.",james
Bravo Lancaster!,james
The red rose wins.,james
"Come on now, York!",james
"Forge
ahead!",james
Jack Lawton looked over from his side.,james
"The little silk badge with the
red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on.",james
"Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who
would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he.",james
"Some weeks Jack
Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first.",james
"His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next
sum and heard Father Arnall’s voice.",james
"Then all his eagerness passed away
and he felt his face quite cool.",james
"He thought his face must be white
because it felt so cool.",james
"He could not get out the answer for the sum
but it did not matter.",james
"White roses and red roses: those were beautiful
colours to think of.",james
"And the cards for first place and second place and
third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender.",james
Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of.,james
"Perhaps a
wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about
the wild rose blossoms on the little green place.",james
"But you could not
have a green rose.",james
But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.,james
"The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and
along the corridors towards the refectory.",james
"He sat looking at the two
prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread.",james
"The
tablecloth was damp and limp.",james
"But he drank off the hot weak tea which
the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup.",james
"He
wondered whether the scullion’s apron was damp too or whether all white
things were cold and damp.",james
"Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that
their people sent them in tins.",james
"They said they could not drink the tea;
that it was hogwash.",james
"Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.",james
All the boys seemed to him very strange.,james
"They had all fathers and
mothers and different clothes and voices.",james
"He longed to be at home and
lay his head on his mother’s lap.",james
"But he could not: and so he longed
for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed.",james
"He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said:

—What’s up?",james
Have you a pain or what’s up with you?,james
"—I don’t know, Stephen said.",james
"—Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks white.",james
It will go away.,james
"—O yes, Stephen said.",james
But he was not sick there.,james
"He thought that he was sick in his heart if
you could be sick in that place.",james
Fleming was very decent to ask him.,james
"He
wanted to cry.",james
"He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened
the flaps of his ears.",james
"Then he heard the noise of the refectory every
time he opened the flaps of his ears.",james
"It made a roar like a train at
night.",james
"And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train
going into a tunnel.",james
"That night at Dalkey the train had roared like
that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped.",james
"He
closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping;
roaring again, stopping.",james
"It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then
roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.",james
"Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in
the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the
Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who
wore the woolly cap.",james
"And then the lower line tables and the tables of
the third line.",james
And every single fellow had a different way of walking.,james
"He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of
dominos and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the little
song of the gas.",james
"The prefect was at the door with some boys and Simon
Moonan was knotting his false sleeves.",james
"He was telling them something
about Tullabeg.",james
"Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and
said:

—Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed?",james
"Stephen answered:

—I do.",james
"Wells turned to the other fellows and said:

—O, I say, here’s a fellow says he kisses his mother every night before
he goes to bed.",james
"The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, laughing.",james
"Stephen blushed under their eyes and said:

—I do not.",james
"Wells said:

—O, I say, here’s a fellow says he doesn’t kiss his mother before he
goes to bed.",james
They all laughed again.,james
Stephen tried to laugh with them.,james
"He felt his
whole body hot and confused in a moment.",james
"What was the right answer to
the question?",james
He had given two and still Wells laughed.,james
"But Wells must
know the right answer for he was in third of grammar.",james
"He tried to think
of Wells’s mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells’s
face.",james
He did not like Wells’s face.,james
"It was Wells who had shouldered him
into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his
little snuffbox for Wells’s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of
forty.",james
It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was.,james
"And how
cold and slimy the water had been!",james
"And a fellow had once seen a big rat
jump plop into the scum.",james
"The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell
rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the
cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes.",james
"He still
tried to think what was the right answer.",james
"Was it right to kiss his
mother or wrong to kiss his mother?",james
"What did that mean, to kiss?",james
"You
put your face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her
face down.",james
"﻿THE SISTERS


There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.",james
"Night
after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied
the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it
lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly.",james
"If he was dead, I thought,
I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew
that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse.",james
"He had often said
to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words
idle.",james
Now I knew they were true.,james
"Every night as I gazed up at the
window I said softly to myself the word paralysis.",james
"It had always
sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and
the word simony in the Catechism.",james
"But now it sounded to me like the
name of some maleficent and sinful being.",james
"It filled me with fear, and
yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.",james
"Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to
supper.",james
"While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if
returning to some former remark of his:

“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer
... there was something uncanny about him.",james
"I’ll tell you my
opinion....”

He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his
mind.",james
Tiresome old fool!,james
"When we knew him first he used to be rather
interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him
and his endless stories about the distillery.",james
"“I have my own theory about it,” he said.",james
"“I think it was one of those
... peculiar cases....",james
"But it’s hard to say....”

He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory.",james
"My
uncle saw me staring and said to me:

“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”

“Who?” said I.",james
"“Father Flynn.”

“Is he dead?”

“Mr Cotter here has just told us.",james
"He was passing by the house.”

I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the
news had not interested me.",james
My uncle explained to old Cotter.,james
“The youngster and he were great friends.,james
"The old chap taught him a
great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”

“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously.",james
Old Cotter looked at me for a while.,james
"I felt that his little beady black
eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from
my plate.",james
"He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the
grate.",james
"“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say
to a man like that.”

“How do you mean, Mr Cotter?” asked my aunt.",james
"“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children.",james
"My idea is:
let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and
not be.... Am I right, Jack?”

“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle.",james
"“Let him learn to box his
corner.",james
"That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take
exercise.",james
"Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a
cold bath, winter and summer.",james
And that’s what stands to me now.,james
"Education is all very fine and large.... Mr Cotter might take a pick of
that leg mutton,” he added to my aunt.",james
"“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter.",james
My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.,james
"“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr Cotter?” she
asked.",james
"“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their minds are so
impressionable.",james
"When children see things like that, you know, it has an
effect....”

I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my
anger.",james
Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!,james
It was late when I fell asleep.,james
"Though I was angry with old Cotter for
alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from
his unfinished sentences.",james
"In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw
again the heavy grey face of the paralytic.",james
"I drew the blankets over my
head and tried to think of Christmas.",james
"But the grey face still followed
me.",james
It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something.,james
"I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and
there again I found it waiting for me.",james
"It began to confess to me in a
murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the
lips were so moist with spittle.",james
"But then I remembered that it had died
of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve
the simoniac of his sin.",james
"The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little
house in Great Britain Street.",james
"It was an unassuming shop, registered
under the vague name of _Drapery_.",james
"The drapery consisted mainly of
children’s bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to
hang in the window, saying: _Umbrellas Re-covered_.",james
"No notice was
visible now for the shutters were up.",james
"A crape bouquet was tied to the
door-knocker with ribbon.",james
"Two poor women and a telegram boy were
reading the card pinned on the crape.",james
"I also approached and read:

     July 1st, 1895
     The Rev.",james
"James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s
     Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.",james
_R.,james
"I. P._

The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was
disturbed to find myself at check.",james
"Had he not been dead I would have
gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in
his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat.",james
"Perhaps
my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this
present would have roused him from his stupefied doze.",james
"It was always I
who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled
too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about
the floor.",james
"Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose
little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of
his coat.",james
"It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave
his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red
handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a
week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite
inefficacious.",james
I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock.,james
"I
walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the
theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went.",james
"I found it
strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt
even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I
had been freed from something by his death.",james
"I wondered at this for, as
my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal.",james
"He
had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to
pronounce Latin properly.",james
"He had told me stories about the catacombs
and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of
the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments
worn by the priest.",james
"Sometimes he had amused himself by putting
difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain
circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or
only imperfections.",james
"His questions showed me how complex and mysterious
were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as
the simplest acts.",james
"The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and
towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I
wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake
them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the
Church had written books as thick as the _Post Office Directory_ and as
closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all
these intricate questions.",james
"Often when I thought of this I could make no
answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to
smile and nod his head twice or thrice.",james
"Sometimes he used to put me
through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart;
and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now
and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.",james
"When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his
tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in
the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well.",james
"As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried
to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream.",james
"I remembered
that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique
fashion.",james
"I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the
customs were strange—in Persia, I thought....",james
"But I could not remember
the end of the dream.",james
In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.,james
"It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to
the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds.",james
"Nannie
received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have
shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all.",james
"The old woman
pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to
toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely
above the level of the banister-rail.",james
"At the first landing she stopped
and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the
dead-room.",james
"My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated
to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand.",james
I went in on tiptoe.,james
"The room through the lace end of the blind was
suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like
pale thin flames.",james
He had been coffined.,james
"Nannie gave the lead and we
three knelt down at the foot of the bed.",james
"I pretended to pray but I
could not gather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings
distracted me.",james
"I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back
and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side.",james
"The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in
his coffin.",james
But no.,james
"When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he
was not smiling.",james
"There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the
altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice.",james
"His face was very
truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled
by a scanty white fur.",james
There was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers.,james
We blessed ourselves and came away.,james
"In the little room downstairs we
found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state.",james
"I groped my way towards
my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and
brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses.",james
"She set these
on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine.",james
"Then, at
her sister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and
passed them to us.",james
"She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but
I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.",james
"She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over
quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister.",james
"No one spoke:
we all gazed at the empty fireplace.",james
"My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:

“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”

Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent.",james
"My aunt fingered the
stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little.",james
“Did he ... peacefully?” she asked.,james
"“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza.",james
"“You couldn’t tell when the
breath went out of him.",james
"He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”

“And everything...?”

“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and
prepared him and all.”

“He knew then?”

“He was quite resigned.”

“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt.",james
“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said.,james
"She said he just
looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned.",james
"No
one would think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”

“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt.",james
"She sipped a little more from her glass and said:

“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to
know that you did all you could for him.",james
"You were both very kind to
him, I must say.”

Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees.",james
"“Ah, poor James!” she said.",james
"“God knows we done all we could, as poor as
we are—we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”

Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to
fall asleep.",james
"“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out.",james
"All
the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then
laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in
the chapel.",james
"Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d have done
at all.",james
"It was him brought us all them flowers and them two
candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the
_Freeman’s General_ and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery
and poor James’s insurance.”

“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt.",james
Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly.,james
"“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is
said and done, no friends that a body can trust.”

“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt.",james
"“And I’m sure now that he’s gone
to his eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to
him.”

“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza.",james
“He was no great trouble to us.,james
"You
wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now.",james
"Still, I know he’s
gone and all to that....”

“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt.",james
"“I know that,” said Eliza.",james
"“I won’t be bringing him in his cup of
beef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff.",james
"Ah, poor
James!”

She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said
shrewdly:

“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him
latterly.",james
"Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with
his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth
open.”

She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:

“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over
he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again
where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with
him.",james
"If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes
no noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic
wheels, for the day cheap—he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there
and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening.",james
"He had his
mind set on that.... Poor James!”

“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt.",james
Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it.,james
"Then she
put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some
time without speaking.",james
"“He was too scrupulous always,” she said.",james
"“The duties of the priesthood
was too much for him.",james
"And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”

“Yes,” said my aunt.",james
“He was a disappointed man.,james
"You could see that.”

A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I
approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to
my chair in the corner.",james
Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.,james
"We waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long
pause she said slowly:

“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it.",james
"Of
course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.",james
But still....,james
They say it was the boy’s fault.,james
"But poor James was so
nervous, God be merciful to him!”

“And was that it?” said my aunt.",james
"“I heard something....”

Eliza nodded.",james
"“That affected his mind,” she said.",james
"“After that he began to mope by
himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself.",james
"So one night
he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.",james
"They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight
of him anywhere.",james
So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel.,james
"So then
they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father
O’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to
look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by
himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like
softly to himself?”

She stopped suddenly as if to listen.",james
"I too listened; but there was no
sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in
his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle
chalice on his breast.",james
"Eliza resumed:

“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself....",james
"So then, of course, when
they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong
with him....”




AN ENCOUNTER


It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us.",james
"He had a little
library made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The
Halfpenny Marvel_.",james
"Every evening after school we met in his back garden
and arranged Indian battles.",james
"He and his fat young brother Leo, the
idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm;
or we fought a pitched battle on the grass.",james
"But, however well we
fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe
Dillon’s war dance of victory.",james
"His parents went to eight-o’clock mass
every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon
was prevalent in the hall of the house.",james
"But he played too fiercely for
us who were younger and more timid.",james
"He looked like some kind of an
Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head,
beating a tin with his fist and yelling:

“Ya!",james
"yaka, yaka, yaka!”

Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation
for the priesthood.",james
Nevertheless it was true.,james
"A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its
influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived.",james
"We
banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in
fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were
afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one.",james
"The
adventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from
my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape.",james
"I liked better
some American detective stories which were traversed from time to time
by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls.",james
"Though there was nothing wrong
in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they
were circulated secretly at school.",james
"One day when Father Butler was
hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was
discovered with a copy of _The Halfpenny Marvel_.",james
“This page or this page?,james
This page?,james
"Now, Dillon, up!",james
"_‘Hardly had the
day’...._ Go on!",james
What day?,james
"_‘Hardly had the day dawned’...._ Have you
studied it?",james
"What have you there in your pocket?”

Everyone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and
everyone assumed an innocent face.",james
"Father Butler turned over the pages,
frowning.",james
“What is this rubbish?” he said.,james
"“_The Apache Chief!_ Is this what you
read instead of studying your Roman History?",james
"Let me not find any more
of this wretched stuff in this college.",james
"The man who wrote it, I
suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink.",james
"I’m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff.",james
"I could
understand it if you were ... National School boys.",james
"Now, Dillon, I
advise you strongly, get at your work or....”

This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of
the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened
one of my consciences.",james
"But when the restraining influence of the school
was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the
escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me.",james
"The
mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the
routine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to
happen to myself.",james
"But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to
people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.",james
"The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break
out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least.",james
"With Leo
Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching.",james
"Each of us
saved up sixpence.",james
"We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal
Bridge.",james
"Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo
Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick.",james
"We arranged to go
along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the
ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House.",james
"Leo Dillon was afraid
we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony
asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the
Pigeon House.",james
"We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the
plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same
time showing them my own sixpence.",james
"When we were making the last
arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited.",james

[ 1 ]

Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.",james
"A yellow
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air.",james
"He held the bowl aloft and intoned:

—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.",james
"Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

—Come up, Kinch!",james
"Come up, you fearful jesuit!",james
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.,james
"He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains.",james
"Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head.",james
"Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.",james
"Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.",james
—Back to barracks!,james
he said sternly.,james
"He added in a preacher’s tone:

—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns.",james
"Slow music, please.",james
"Shut your eyes, gents.",james
"One
moment.",james
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.,james
"Silence, all.",james
"He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points.",james
Chrysostomos.,james
"Two strong shrill whistles
answered through the calm.",james
"—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.",james
That will do nicely.,james
"Switch off
the current, will you?",james
"He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown.",james
"The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.",james
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.,james
—The mockery of it!,james
he said gaily.,james
"Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!",james
"He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.",james
"Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.",james
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.,james
"—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.",james
"But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?",james
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.,james
"We
must go to Athens.",james
"Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?",james
"He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

—Will he come?",james
The jejune jesuit!,james
"Ceasing, he began to shave with care.",james
"—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.",james
"—Yes, my love?",james
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?,james
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.,james
"—God, isn’t he dreadful?",james
he said frankly.,james
A ponderous Saxon.,james
"He thinks
you’re not a gentleman.",james
"God, these bloody English!",james
"Bursting with money
and indigestion.",james
Because he comes from Oxford.,james
"You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner.",james
He can’t make you out.,james
"O, my name for you
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.",james
He shaved warily over his chin.,james
"—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.",james
"Where is
his guncase?",james
—A woful lunatic!,james
Mulligan said.,james
Were you in a funk?,james
"—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.",james
"Out here in the dark
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther.",james
You saved men from drowning.,james
"I’m not a hero, however.",james
"If
he stays on here I am off.",james
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.,james
"He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.",james
—Scutter!,james
he cried thickly.,james
"He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
pocket, said:

—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.",james
"Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief.",james
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.,james
"Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

—The bard’s noserag!",james
A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.,james
"You can almost taste it, can’t you?",james
"He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.",james
—God!,james
he said quietly.,james
"Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother?",james
The snotgreen sea.,james
The scrotumtightening sea.,james
"_Epi oinopa
ponton_.",james
"Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks!",james
I must teach you.,james
"You must read them
in the original.",james
_Thalatta!,james
Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.,james
Come and look.,james
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.,james
"Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown.",james
—Our mighty mother!,james
Buck Mulligan said.,james
"He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face.",james
"—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.",james
"That’s why she won’t
let me have anything to do with you.",james
"—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.",james
"—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
asked you, Buck Mulligan said.",james
I’m hyperborean as much as you.,james
"But to
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
pray for her.",james
And you refused.,james
There is something sinister in you....,james
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.,james
"A tolerant
smile curled his lips.",james
—But a lovely mummer!,james
he murmured to himself.,james
"Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!",james
"He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.",james
"Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.",james
"Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.",james
"Silently,
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes.",james
"Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.",james
"The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.",james
"A bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.",james
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.,james
"—Ah, poor dogsbody!",james
he said in a kind voice.,james
"I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags.",james
How are the secondhand breeks?,james
"—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.",james
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.,james
"—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.",james
Secondleg they should be.,james
"God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off.",james
"I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey.",james
You’ll look spiffing in them.,james
"I’m not joking, Kinch.",james
"You
look damn well when you’re dressed.",james
"—Thanks, Stephen said.",james
I can’t wear them if they are grey.,james
"—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.",james
Etiquette is etiquette.,james
"He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers.",james
"He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.",james
"Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.",james
"—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.",james
General paralysis of the insane!,james
"He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.",james
"His curling shaven lips
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.",james
"Laughter seized
all his strong wellknit trunk.",james
"—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!",james
"Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack.",james
Hair on end.,james
As he and others see me.,james
"Who chose this
face for me?",james
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.,james
It asks me too.,james
"—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.",james
"It does her
all right.",james
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.,james
Lead him not into temptation.,james
And her name is Ursula.,james
"Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.",james
"—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.",james
"If
Wilde were only alive to see you!",james
"Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:

—It is a symbol of Irish art.",james
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.,james
"Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them.",james
"—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?",james
he said kindly.,james
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.,james
Parried again.,james
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.,james
"The
cold steel pen.",james
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant!,james
"Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a guinea.",james
"He’s stinking with money and
thinks you’re not a gentleman.",james
"His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.",james
"God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might do something for the island.",james
Hellenise it.,james
Cranly’s arm.,james
His arm.,james
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.,james
"I’m the only one
that knows what you are.",james
Why don’t you trust me more?,james
"What have you up
your nose against me?",james
Is it Haines?,james
"If he makes any noise here I’ll
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
Clive Kempthorpe.",james
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.,james
"Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.",james
"O, I shall
expire!",james
"Break the news to her gently, Aubrey!",james
I shall die!,james
"With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears.",james
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.,james
"I don’t
want to be debagged!",james
Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!,james
Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.,james
"A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.",james
To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.,james
"—Let him stay, Stephen said.",james
"There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night.",james
—Then what is it?,james
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.,james
Cough it up.,james
"I’m
quite frank with you.",james
What have you against me now?,james
"They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.",james
"Stephen freed his arm
quietly.",james
—Do you wish me to tell you?,james
"﻿CHAPTER I


Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and
happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
little to distress or vex her.",jane
"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage,
been mistress of his house from a very early period.",jane
"Her mother had
died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance
of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman
as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.",jane
"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse’s family, less as a
governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly
of Emma.",jane
Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters.,jane
"Even
before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,
the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any
restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they
had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,
and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor’s
judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.",jane
"The real evils, indeed, of Emma’s situation were the power of having
rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too
well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to
her many enjoyments.",jane
"The danger, however, was at present so
unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with
her.",jane
"Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any
disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married.",jane
"It was Miss Taylor’s
loss which first brought grief.",jane
"It was on the wedding-day of this
beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any
continuance.",jane
"The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father
and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to
cheer a long evening.",jane
"Her father composed himself to sleep after
dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she
had lost.",jane
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.,jane
"Mr. Weston was
a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and
pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with
what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and
promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her.",jane
"The want
of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.",jane
"She recalled her
past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had
taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had
devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed
her through the various illnesses of childhood.",jane
"A large debt of
gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,
the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed
Isabella’s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a
dearer, tenderer recollection.",jane
"She had been a friend and companion such
as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing
all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and
peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of
hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had
such an affection for her as could never find fault.",jane
"How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going
only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the
difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a
Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and
domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual
solitude.",jane
"She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.",jane
"He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.",jane
"The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had
not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;
for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind
or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though
everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable
temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.",jane
"Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being
settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily
reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled
through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from
Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
and give her pleasant society again.",jane
"Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,
to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and
name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.",jane
"The Woodhouses were
first in consequence there.",jane
All looked up to them.,jane
"She had many
acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but
not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for
even half a day.",jane
"It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but
sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,
and made it necessary to be cheerful.",jane
His spirits required support.,jane
"He
was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was
used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.",jane
"Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was
by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter’s marrying, nor could
ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a
match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor
too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able
to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he
was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for
herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she
had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.",jane
"Emma smiled and
chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but
when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had
said at dinner,

“Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again.",jane
"What a pity it is that
Mr. Weston ever thought of her!”

“I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.",jane
"Mr. Weston is such a
good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a
good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for
ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her
own?”

“A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?",jane
"This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my
dear.”

“How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We
shall be always meeting!",jane
"_We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding
visit very soon.”

“My dear, how am I to get so far?",jane
Randalls is such a distance.,jane
"I could
not walk half so far.”

“No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.",jane
"We must go in the carriage,
to be sure.”

“The carriage!",jane
"But James will not like to put the horses to for such a
little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our
visit?”

“They are to be put into Mr. Weston’s stable, papa.",jane
"You know we have
settled all that already.",jane
"We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last
night.",jane
"And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going
to Randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there.",jane
"I only
doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.",jane
"That was your doing,
papa.",jane
You got Hannah that good place.,jane
"Nobody thought of Hannah till you
mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!”

“I am very glad I did think of her.",jane
"It was very lucky, for I would not
have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am
sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken
girl; I have a great opinion of her.",jane
"Whenever I see her, she always
curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you
have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock
of the door the right way and never bangs it.",jane
"I am sure she will be an
excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor
to have somebody about her that she is used to see.",jane
"Whenever James goes
over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us.",jane
"He will
be able to tell her how we all are.”

Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and
hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through
the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.",jane
"The
backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards
walked in and made it unnecessary.",jane
"Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella’s husband.",jane
"He lived
about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,
and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their
mutual connexions in London.",jane
"He had returned to a late dinner, after
some days’ absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were
well in Brunswick Square.",jane
"It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.
Woodhouse for some time.",jane
"Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which
always did him good; and his many inquiries after “poor Isabella” and
her children were answered most satisfactorily.",jane
"When this was over, Mr.
Woodhouse gratefully observed, “It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,
to come out at this late hour to call upon us.",jane
"I am afraid you must
have had a shocking walk.”

“Not at all, sir.",jane
"It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I
must draw back from your great fire.”

“But you must have found it very damp and dirty.",jane
"I wish you may not
catch cold.”

“Dirty, sir!",jane
Look at my shoes.,jane
"Not a speck on them.”

“Well!",jane
"that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain
here.",jane
"It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at
breakfast.",jane
"I wanted them to put off the wedding.”

“By the bye—I have not wished you joy.",jane
"Being pretty well aware of what
sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my
congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.",jane
"How did you
all behave?",jane
"Who cried most?”

“Ah!",jane
poor Miss Taylor!,jane
"’Tis a sad business.”

“Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say
‘poor Miss Taylor.’ I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it
comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it
must be better to have only one to please than two.”

“Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome
creature!” said Emma playfully.",jane
"“That is what you have in your head, I
know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.”

“I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,” said Mr. Woodhouse, with
a sigh.",jane
"“I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.”

“My dearest papa!",jane
"You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.
Knightley to mean _you_.",jane
What a horrible idea!,jane
Oh no!,jane
"I meant only
myself.",jane
"Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a
joke—it is all a joke.",jane
"We always say what we like to one another.”

Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults
in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and
though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it
would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him
really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by
every body.",jane
"“Emma knows I never flatter her,” said Mr. Knightley, “but I meant no
reflection on any body.",jane
"Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons
to please; she will now have but one.",jane
"The chances are that she must be
a gainer.”

“Well,” said Emma, willing to let it pass—“you want to hear about the
wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved
charmingly.",jane
"Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:
not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.",jane
"Oh no; we all felt that
we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting
every day.”

“Dear Emma bears every thing so well,” said her father.",jane
"“But, Mr.
Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am
sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.”

Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.",jane
"“It is
impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,” said Mr.
Knightley.",jane
"“We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could
suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor’s
advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor’s
time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to
her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow
herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.",jane
"Every friend of Miss Taylor
must be glad to have her so happily married.”

“And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said Emma, “and a
very considerable one—that I made the match myself.",jane
"I made the match,
you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in
the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,
may comfort me for any thing.”

Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.",jane
"Her father fondly replied, “Ah!",jane
"my
dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for
whatever you say always comes to pass.",jane
"Pray do not make any more
matches.”

“I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for
other people.",jane
It is the greatest amusement in the world!,jane
"And after such
success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry
again.",jane
"Oh dear, no!",jane
"Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who
seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied
either in his business in town or among his friends here, always
acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr.",jane
"Weston need not spend
a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it.",jane
Oh no!,jane
"Mr.
Weston certainly would never marry again.",jane
"Some people even talked of a
promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the
uncle not letting him.",jane
"All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the
subject, but I believed none of it.",jane
"“Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met
with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted
away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
Farmer Mitchell’s, I made up my mind on the subject.",jane
"I planned the
match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this
instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off
match-making.”

“I do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said Mr. Knightley.",jane
“Success supposes endeavour.,jane
"Your time has been properly and delicately
spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
about this marriage.",jane
A worthy employment for a young lady’s mind!,jane
"But
if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,
means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘I
think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were
to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then
afterwards, why do you talk of success?",jane
Where is your merit?,jane
"What are
you proud of?",jane
"You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be
said.”

“And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I
pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is
never merely luck.",jane
There is always some talent in it.,jane
"And as to my poor
word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so
entirely without any claim to it.",jane
"You have drawn two pretty pictures;
but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and
the do-all.",jane
"If I had not promoted Mr. Weston’s visits here, and given
many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might
not have come to any thing after all.",jane
"I think you must know Hartfield
enough to comprehend that.”

“A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,
unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their
own concerns.",jane
"You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than
good to them, by interference.”

“Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined
Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.",jane
"“But, my dear, pray do not
make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family
circle grievously.”

“Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.",jane
Poor Mr. Elton!,jane
"You like Mr.
Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him.",jane
"There is nobody in
Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has
fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have
him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands
to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same
kind office done for him!",jane
"I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is
the only way I have of doing him a service.”

“Mr.",jane
"Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good
young man, and I have a great regard for him.",jane
"But if you want to shew
him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.",jane
That will be a much better thing.,jane
"I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so
kind as to meet him.”

“With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,” said Mr. Knightley,
laughing, “and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better
thing.",jane
"Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish
and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.",jane
"Depend upon it, a
man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.”




CHAPTER II


Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into
gentility and property.",jane
"He had received a good education, but, on
succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed
for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,
and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by
entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.",jane
"Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his
military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great
Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was
surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and
who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would
offend.",jane
"Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her
fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was
not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the
infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off
with due decorum.",jane
"It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce
much happiness.",jane
"Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had
a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing
due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;
but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best.",jane
"She had
resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but
not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s
unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.",jane
"They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison
of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at
once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.",jane
"Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,
as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of
the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he
was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.",jane
"From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.",jane
"The boy
had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his
mother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.
Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young
creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge
of the little Frank soon after her decease.",jane
"Some scruples and some
reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they
were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the
care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort
to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.",jane
A complete change of life became desirable.,jane
"He quitted the militia and
engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in
London, which afforded him a favourable opening.",jane
"It was a concern which
brought just employment enough.",jane
"He had still a small house in Highbury,
where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful
occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty
years of his life passed cheerfully away.",jane
"He had, by that time,
realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little
estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to
marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according
to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.",jane
"It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his
schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it
had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could
purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;
but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were
accomplished.",jane
"He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained
his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every
probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.",jane
"He had
never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,
even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful
a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the
pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be
chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.",jane
"He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;
for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his
uncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume
the name of Churchill on coming of age.",jane
"It was most unlikely,
therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance.",jane
"His father
had no apprehension of it.",jane
"The aunt was a capricious woman, and
governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston’s nature to
imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,
and, as he believed, so deservedly dear.",jane
"He saw his son every year in
London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine
young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.",jane
"He was
looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and
prospects a kind of common concern.",jane
"Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively
curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little
returned that he had never been there in his life.",jane
"His coming to visit
his father had been often talked of but never achieved.",jane
"Now, upon his father’s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a
most proper attention, that the visit should take place.",jane
"There was not
a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea
with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the
visit.",jane
"Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and
the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his
new mother on the occasion.",jane
"For a few days, every morning visit in
Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had
received.",jane
"“I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank
Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston?",jane
"I understand it was a very
handsome letter, indeed.",jane
Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.,jane
"Mr. Woodhouse saw
the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his
life.”

It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.",jane
"Mrs. Weston had, of course,
formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most
welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation
which her marriage had already secured.",jane
"She felt herself a most
fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate
she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial
separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and
who could ill bear to part with her.",jane
"She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without
pain, of Emma’s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour’s ennui,
from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble
character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would
have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped
would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and
privations.",jane
"And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance
of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female
walking, and in Mr. Weston’s disposition and circumstances, which would
make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the
evenings in the week together.",jane
"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.
Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more
than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,
that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize
at his being still able to pity ‘poor Miss Taylor,’ when they left her
at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away
in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her
own.",jane
"But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse’s giving a gentle sigh,
and saying, “Ah, poor Miss Taylor!",jane
"She would be very glad to stay.”

There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to
pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.",jane
"The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by
being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which
had been a great distress to him, was all eat up.",jane
"His own stomach could
bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be
different from himself.",jane
"What was unwholesome to him he regarded as
unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade
them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as
earnestly tried to prevent any body’s eating it.",jane
"He had been at the
pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.",jane
"Mr.
Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were
one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse’s life; and upon being applied to,
he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias
of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with
many—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.",jane
"With such an
opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence
every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;
and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.",jane
"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being
seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.
Woodhouse would never believe it.",jane
"CHAPTER III


Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.",jane
"He liked very much to
have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from
his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,
his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own
little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.",jane
"He had not much
intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late
hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance
but such as would visit him on his own terms.",jane
"Fortunately for him,
Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in
the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many
such.",jane
"Not unfrequently, through Emma’s persuasion, he had some of the
chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he
preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to
company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could
not make up a card-table for him.",jane
"Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and
by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege
of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the
elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles
of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.",jane
"After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were
Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at
the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and
carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for
either James or the horses.",jane
"Had it taken place only once a year, it
would have been a grievance.",jane
"Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old
lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.",jane
"She lived with her
single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the
regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward
circumstances, can excite.",jane
"Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree
of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.",jane
"Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having
much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to
make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into
outward respect.",jane
She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.,jane
"Her
youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was
devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a
small income go as far as possible.",jane
"And yet she was a happy woman, and
a woman whom no one named without good-will.",jane
"It was her own universal
good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.",jane
"She loved
every body, was interested in every body’s happiness, quicksighted to
every body’s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and
surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good
neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.",jane
"The
simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful
spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to
herself.",jane
"She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly
suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless
gossip.",jane
"Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary, or an
establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of
refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant
morality, upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies
for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a
real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable
quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where
girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into
a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.",jane
"Mrs.
Goddard’s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury
was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and
garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about
a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with
her own hands.",jane
"It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now
walked after her to church.",jane
﻿Chapter I.],jane
"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.",jane
"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.",jane
"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.",jane
"“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”

Mr. Bennet made no answer.",jane
"“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.",jane
"“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”

[Illustration:

“He came down to see the place”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

This was invitation enough.",jane
"“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.”

“What is his name?”

“Bingley.”

“Is he married or single?”

“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure!",jane
"A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year.",jane
"What a fine thing for our girls!”

“How so?",jane
"how can it affect them?”

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome?",jane
"You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

“Is that his design in settling here?”

“Design?",jane
"Nonsense, how can you talk so!",jane
"But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”

“I see no occasion for that.",jane
"You and the girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party.”

“My dear, you flatter me.",jane
"I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.",jane
"When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”

“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”

“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.”

“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”

“But consider your daughters.",jane
"Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.",jane
"Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers.",jane
"Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.”

“You are over scrupulous, surely.",jane
"I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”

“I desire you will do no such thing.",jane
"Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia.",jane
"But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”

“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”

“Mr.",jane
"Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?",jane
"You take
delight in vexing me.",jane
"You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”

“You mistake me, my dear.",jane
I have a high respect for your nerves.,jane
"They
are my old friends.",jane
"I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.”

“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”

“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”

“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.”

“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.”

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.",jane
"_Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.",jane
"She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.",jane
"When she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous.",jane
"The business of her life was to get her
daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.",jane

CHAPTER II.",jane
"[Illustration]

Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.",jane
"He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it.",jane
"It was then disclosed in the following
manner.",jane
"Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--

“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”

“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”

“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”

“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.",jane
"She has two nieces
of her own.",jane
"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.”

“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",jane
"“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake!",jane
"Have a little
compassion on my nerves.",jane
"You tear them to pieces.”

“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”

“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully.",jane
"“When
is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”

“To-morrow fortnight.”

“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
she will not know him herself.”

“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.”

“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”

“I honour your circumspection.",jane
"A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
very little.",jane
"One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.",jane
"But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I
will take it on myself.”

The girls stared at their father.",jane
"Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”

“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.",jane
"“Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?",jane
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.,jane
"What say you,
Mary?",jane
"For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books, and make extracts.”

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.",jane
"“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”

“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",jane
“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before?,jane
"If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.",jane
"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.”

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.",jane
"“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!",jane
"But I knew I should
persuade you at last.",jane
"I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.",jane
"Well, how pleased I am!",jane
"And it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.”

“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",jane
"“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
shut.",jane
"“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.",jane
"At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes we would do anything.",jane
"Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”

“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I’m the tallest.”

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.",jane

CHAPTER III.",jane
"[Illustration]

Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.",jane
"They attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas.",jane
Her report was highly favourable.,jane
"Sir William had been
delighted with him.",jane
"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.",jane
Nothing could be more delightful!,jane
"To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.",jane
"“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.",jane
"He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.",jane
"The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.",jane
"An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.",jane
"Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc.",jane
"Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted.",jane
"She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.",jane
"Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his

being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.",jane
"The girls grieved over such a
number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,
his five sisters and a cousin.",jane
"And when the party entered the
assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.",jane
"Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.",jane
"His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.",jane
"His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.",jane
"The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.",jane
"Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.",jane
"Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.",jane
What a contrast between him and his friend!,jane
"Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",jane
His character was decided.,jane
"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",jane
"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.",jane
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it.",jane
"“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.",jane
"I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.",jane
"You had much better
dance.”

“I certainly shall not.",jane
"You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.",jane
"At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.",jane
"Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”

“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a
kingdom!",jane
"Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.”

“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",jane
"“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!",jane
"But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable.",jane
"Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”

[Illustration:

“She is tolerable”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.",jane
"You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”

Mr. Bingley followed his advice.",jane
"Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.",jane
"She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",jane
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.,jane
"Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.",jane
"Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.",jane
"Jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.",jane
"Elizabeth felt Jane’s
pleasure.",jane
"Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.",jane
"They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.",jane
They found Mr. Bennet still up.,jane
"With a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.",jane
"He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.",jane
"“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.",jane
I wish you had been there.,jane
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.",jane
"Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.",jane
"Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.",jane
"First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.",jane
"I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.",jane
"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.",jane
"Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”

“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much!",jane
"For God’s sake, say no more of
his partners.",jane
"O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”

“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him.",jane
"He
is so excessively handsome!",jane
and his sisters are charming women.,jane
"I never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.",jane
"I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”

Here she was interrupted again.",jane
"Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery.",jane
"She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",jane
"“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.",jane
"So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him!",jane
"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!",jane
Not handsome enough to dance with!,jane
"I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.",jane
"I quite detest the man.”

CHAPTER IV.",jane
"[Illustration]

When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.",jane
"“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!",jane
"so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!”

“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can.",jane
"His character is thereby complete.”

“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.",jane
"I
did not expect such a compliment.”

“Did not you?",jane
_I_ did for you.,jane
"But that is one great difference between
us.",jane
"Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.",jane
"What
could be more natural than his asking you again?",jane
"He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.",jane
No thanks to his gallantry for that.,jane
"Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.",jane
"You have liked many a
stupider person.”

“Dear Lizzy!”

“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.",jane
You never see a fault in anybody.,jane
"All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.",jane
"I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”

“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.”

“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.",jane
"With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!",jane
"Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere.",jane
"But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone.",jane
"And so, you like this man’s sisters,
too, do you?",jane
"Their manners are not equal to his.”

“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.",jane
"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them.",jane
"They were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.",jane
"They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others.",jane
"They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.",jane
"Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.",jane
"Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.",jane
"His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.",jane
"Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
look at Netherfield House.",jane
"He did look at it, and into it, for half an
hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",jane
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.",jane
"Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied.",jane
"On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.",jane
"In
understanding, Darcy was the superior.",jane
"Bingley was by no means
deficient; but Darcy was clever.",jane
"He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting.",jane
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.,jane
"Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually
giving offence.",jane
"The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.",jane
"Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.",jane
"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.",jane
"Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.",jane
"Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.",jane
"Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.",jane
"[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]




CHAPTER V.


[Illustration]

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.",jane
"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.",jane
"The
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.",jane
"It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.",jane
"For,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to everybody.",jane
"By nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous.",jane
"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.",jane
They had several children.,jane
"The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s intimate friend.",jane
"That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.",jane
"“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil
self-command, to Miss Lucas.",jane
"“_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”

“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”

“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.",jane
"To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.”

“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not
I mention it to you?",jane
"Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?",jane
﻿CHAPTER I.,jane
The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.,jane
"Their estate
was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of
their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance.",jane
"The late owner of this estate was a single
man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his
life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.",jane
"But her
death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great
alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received
into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal
inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to
bequeath it.",jane
"In the society of his nephew and niece, and their
children, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent.",jane
"His
attachment to them all increased.",jane
"The constant attention of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from
interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his existence.",jane
"By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present
lady, three daughters.",jane
"The son, a steady respectable young man, was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.",jane
"By his own
marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his
wealth.",jane
"To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent
of what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that
property, could be but small.",jane
"Their mother had nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the
remaining moiety of his first wife’s fortune was also secured to her
child, and he had only a life-interest in it.",jane
"The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other
will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.",jane
"He was neither so
unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;—but
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest.",jane
"Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his son;—but to his son, and his
son’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or
by any sale of its valuable woods.",jane
"The whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and
mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his
own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received
from his niece and her daughters.",jane
"He meant not to be unkind, however,
and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a
thousand pounds a-piece.",jane
"Mr. Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was
cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years,
and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
improvement.",jane
"But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
his only one twelvemonth.",jane
"He survived his uncle no longer; and ten
thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for
his widow and daughters.",jane
"His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.
Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.",jane
"Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable.",jane
"His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his power to do for them.",jane
"He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well
respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties.",jane
"Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have
been made still more respectable than he was:—he might even have been
made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very
fond of his wife.",jane
"But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of
himself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.",jane
"When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds a-piece.",jane
He then really thought himself equal to it.,jane
"The
prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,
besides the remaining half of his own mother’s fortune, warmed his
heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.",jane
"“Yes, he would give
them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome!",jane
"It would
be enough to make them completely easy.",jane
Three thousand pounds!,jane
"he could
spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.” He thought of
it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.",jane
"No sooner was his father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,
arrived with her child and their attendants.",jane
"No one could dispute her
right to come; the house was her husband’s from the moment of his
father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common
feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her_ mind there was
a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of
the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of
immovable disgust.",jane
"Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her husband’s family; but she had had no opportunity, till the
present, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she could act when occasion required it.",jane
"So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the
arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children
determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother.",jane
"Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and
enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence.",jane
"She had an excellent heart;—her disposition was
affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern
them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.",jane
"Marianne’s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor’s.",jane
"She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her
joys, could have no moderation.",jane
"She was generous, amiable, interesting:
she was everything but prudent.",jane
"The resemblance between her and her
mother was strikingly great.",jane
"Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister’s sensibility; but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.",jane
"They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction.",jane
"The agony of grief which
overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was
created again and again.",jane
"They gave themselves up wholly to their
sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could
afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.",jane
"Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she
could exert herself.",jane
"She could consult with her brother, could receive
her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention;
and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage
her to similar forbearance.",jane
"Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but
as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, without
having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal
her sisters at a more advanced period of life.",jane
CHAPTER II.,jane
"Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her
mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors.",jane
"As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself, his wife, and their child.",jane
"He really pressed them, with
some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan
appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could
accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation
was accepted.",jane
"A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight, was exactly what suited her mind.",jane
"In seasons of cheerfulness,
no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater
degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself.",jane
"But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.",jane
"Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters.",jane
"To take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree.",jane
She begged him to think again on the subject.,jane
"How
could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,
of so large a sum?",jane
"And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,
who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no
relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.",jane
"It
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he
to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his
money to his half sisters?",jane
"“It was my father’s last request to me,” replied her husband, “that I
should assist his widow and daughters.”

“He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he
was light-headed at the time.",jane
"Had he been in his right senses, he could
not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your
fortune from your own child.”

“He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only
requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.",jane
"Perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.",jane
"He could
hardly suppose I should neglect them.",jane
"But as he required the promise, I
could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time.",jane
"The
promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.",jane
"Something must be
done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home.”

“Well, then, _let_ something be done for them; but _that_ something
need not be three thousand pounds.",jane
"Consider,” she added, “that when the
money is once parted with, it never can return.",jane
"Your sisters will
marry, and it will be gone for ever.",jane
"If, indeed, it could be restored
to our poor little boy—”

“Why, to be sure,” said her husband, very gravely, “that would make
great difference.",jane
"The time may come when Harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with.",jane
"If he should have a numerous family, for
instance, it would be a very convenient addition.”

“To be sure it would.”

“Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were
diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase
to their fortunes!”

“Oh!",jane
beyond anything great!,jane
"What brother on earth would do half so much
for his sisters, even if _really_ his sisters!",jane
"And as it is—only half
blood!—But you have such a generous spirit!”

“I would not wish to do any thing mean,” he replied.",jane
"“One had rather,
on such occasions, do too much than too little.",jane
"No one, at least, can
think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly
expect more.”

“There is no knowing what _they_ may expect,” said the lady, “but we
are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can
afford to do.”

“Certainly—and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds
a-piece.",jane
"As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mother’s death—a very comfortable
fortune for any young woman.”

“To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all.",jane
"They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them.",jane
"If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do
not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds.”

“That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the
whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives, rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I
mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.",jane
"A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.”

His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this
plan.",jane
"“To be sure,” said she, “it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once.",jane
"But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in.”

“Fifteen years!",jane
"my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that
purchase.”

“Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,
and hardly forty.",jane
"An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over
and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.",jane
"You are not
aware of what you are doing.",jane
"I have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my father’s will, and it is amazing how
disagreeable she found it.",jane
"Twice every year these annuities were to be
paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then
one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing.",jane
My mother was quite sick of it.,jane
"Her income was not her
own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more
unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been
entirely at my mother’s disposal, without any restriction whatever.",jane
"It
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.”

“It is certainly an unpleasant thing,” replied Mr. Dashwood, “to have
those kind of yearly drains on one’s income.",jane
"One’s fortune, as your
mother justly says, is _not_ one’s own.",jane
"To be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it
takes away one’s independence.”

“Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.",jane
"They think
themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises
no gratitude at all.",jane
"If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my
own discretion entirely.",jane
"I would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly.",jane
"It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.”

“I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year.",jane
It will certainly be much the best way.,jane
"A present of fifty
pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my
father.”

“To be sure it will.",jane
"Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all.",jane
"The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,
and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they
are in season.",jane
"I’ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.",jane
"Do but consider,
my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law
and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will
pay their mother for their board out of it.",jane
"Altogether, they will have
five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want
for more than that?—They will live so cheap!",jane
"Their housekeeping will be
nothing at all.",jane
"They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any
servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any
kind!",jane
Only conceive how comfortable they will be!,jane
Five hundred a year!,jane
"I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to
your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.",jane
"They will be
much more able to give _you_ something.”

“Upon my word,” said Mr. Dashwood, “I believe you are perfectly right.",jane
"My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say.",jane
"I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described.",jane
"When my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.",jane
"Some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then.”

“Certainly,” returned Mrs. John Dashwood.",jane
"“But, however, _one_ thing
must be considered.",jane
"When your father and mother moved to Norland,
though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and
linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.",jane
"Her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.”

“That is a material consideration undoubtedly.",jane
"A valuable legacy
indeed!",jane
"And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here.”

“Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house.",jane
"A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for
any place _they_ can ever afford to live in.",jane
"But, however, so it is.",jane
Your father thought only of _them_.,jane
"And I must say this: that you owe
no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we
very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything
in the world to _them_.”

This argument was irresistible.",jane
"It gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be
absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the
widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his own wife pointed out.",jane
CHAPTER III.,jane
"Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when
her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.",jane
"But she could hear
of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease,
and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment
rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother
would have approved.",jane
"Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections.",jane
"She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her
daughters’ sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her in
affluence.",jane
"For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his own
heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.",jane
"His attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the
liberality of his intentions.",jane
"The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character, which half a year’s residence in her family afforded;
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to
the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters’ continuance at
Norland.",jane
"This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young
man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister’s
establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there.",jane
"Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother.",jane
"But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration.",jane
"It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,
that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.",jane
"It
was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition; and that Elinor’s merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.",jane
"Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address.",jane
"He was not handsome, and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.",jane
"He was too diffident
to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,
his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.",jane
"His
understanding was good, and his education had given it solid
improvement.",jane
"But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him
distinguished—as—they hardly knew what.",jane
"They wanted him to make a fine
figure in the world in some manner or other.",jane
"His mother wished to
interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day.",jane
"Mrs. John
Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche.",jane
"But Edward had no turn for
great men or barouches.",jane
"All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and
the quiet of private life.",jane
"Fortunately he had a younger brother who was
more promising.",jane
"Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwood’s attention; for she was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.",jane
"She saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.",jane
"He
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.",jane
"She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a
reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him and his sister.",jane
"It was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother.",jane
"“It is enough,” said she; “to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.",jane
"It
implies everything amiable.",jane
"I love him already.”

“I think you will like him,” said Elinor, “when you know more of him.”

“Like him!” replied her mother with a smile.",jane
"“I feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love.”

“You may esteem him.”

“I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love.”

Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.",jane
"Her manners
were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.",jane
"She speedily
comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his
worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was no
longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
affectionate.",jane
"No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.",jane
"“In a few months, my dear Marianne,” said she, “Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life.",jane
"We shall miss her; but _she_ will be
happy.”

“Oh!",jane
"Mama, how shall we do without her?”

“My love, it will be scarcely a separation.",jane
"We shall live within a few
miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.",jane
"You will
gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.",jane
"I have the highest
opinion in the world of Edward’s heart.",jane
"But you look grave, Marianne;
do you disapprove your sister’s choice?”

“Perhaps,” said Marianne, “I may consider it with some surprise.",jane
"Edward
is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.",jane
"But yet—he is not the kind of
young man—there is something wanting—his figure is not striking; it has
none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously
attach my sister.",jane
"His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at
once announce virtue and intelligence.",jane
"And besides all this, I am
afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.",jane
"Music seems scarcely to attract
him, and though he admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not the
admiration of a person who can understand their worth.",jane
"It is evident,
in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact
he knows nothing of the matter.",jane
"He admires as a lover, not as a
connoisseur.",jane
"To satisfy me, those characters must be united.",jane
"I could
not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide
with my own.",jane
"He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the
same music must charm us both.",jane
Oh!,jane
"mama, how spiritless, how tame was
Edward’s manner in reading to us last night!",jane
"I felt for my sister most
severely.",jane
"Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely
to notice it.",jane
I could hardly keep my seat.,jane
"To hear those beautiful
lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such
impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!”


“He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.",jane
"I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him Cowper.”

“Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow
for difference of taste.",jane
"Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she
may overlook it, and be happy with him.",jane
"But it would have broke _my_
heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.",jane
"Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love.",jane
I require so much!,jane
"He
must have all Edward’s virtues, and his person and manners must
ornament his goodness with every possible charm.”

“Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.",jane
"It is yet too early in
life to despair of such a happiness.",jane
"Why should you be less fortunate
than your mother?",jane
"In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your
destiny be different from hers!”




CHAPTER IV.",jane
"“What a pity it is, Elinor,” said Marianne, “that Edward should have no
taste for drawing.”

“No taste for drawing!” replied Elinor, “why should you think so?",jane
"He
does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of
improving it.",jane
"Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would
have drawn very well.",jane
"He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so
much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture;
but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in
general direct him perfectly right.”

Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the
drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.",jane

The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails, and was at rest.",joseph
"The flood had made, the wind was nearly
calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide.",joseph
"The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of
an interminable waterway.",joseph
"In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails
of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits.",joseph
"A
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.",joseph
"The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
and the greatest, town on earth.",joseph
The Director of Companies was our captain and our host.,joseph
"We four
affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
seaward.",joseph
"On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
nautical.",joseph
"He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
personified.",joseph
"It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.",joseph
"Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of
the sea.",joseph
"Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's
yarns--and even convictions.",joseph
"The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,
because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
and was lying on the only rug.",joseph
"The Accountant had brought out already a
box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.",joseph
"Marlow
sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast.",joseph
"He had
sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,
and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an
idol.",joseph
"The Director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way
aft and sat down amongst us.",joseph
We exchanged a few words lazily.,joseph
"Afterwards
there was silence on board the yacht.",joseph
"For some reason or other we did
not begin that game of dominoes.",joseph
"We felt meditative, and fit for nothing
but placid staring.",joseph
"The day was ending in a serenity of still and
exquisite brilliance.",joseph
"The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a
speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the
Essex marshes was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded
rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds.",joseph
"Only the
gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more somber
every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.",joseph
"And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and
from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,
as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that
gloom brooding over a crowd of men.",joseph
"Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
brilliant but more profound.",joseph
"The old river in its broad reach rested
unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the
race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a
waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth.",joseph
"We looked at the
venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and
departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories.",joseph
"And
indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames.",joseph
"The tidal
current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories
of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles
of the sea.",joseph
"It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is
proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled
and untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea.",joseph
"It had borne all the
ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from
the Golden Hind returning with her round flanks full of treasure, to be
visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,
to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other conquests--and that never
returned.",joseph
It had known the ships and the men.,joseph
"They had sailed from
Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;
kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the
dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals""
of East India fleets.",joseph
"Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all
had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,
messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the
sacred fire.",joseph

mud-flat, shone strongly.",joseph
"Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a great
stir of lights going up and going down.",joseph

reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on
the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.",joseph

could be said of him was that he did not represent his class.",joseph

seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may
so express it, a sedentary life.",joseph

order, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their
country--the sea.",joseph
"One ship is very much like another, and the sea is
always the same.",joseph
"In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign
shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,
veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;
for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,
which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.",joseph
"For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree
on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,
and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing.",joseph
"The yarns of seamen
have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the
shell of a cracked nut.",joseph
"But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity
to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not
inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it
out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these
misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination
of moonshine.",joseph

the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive
experiences.",joseph

wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow
I must get there by hook or by crook.",joseph
So I worried them.,joseph
"The men said
'My dear fellow,' and did nothing.",joseph
"Then--would you believe it?--I tried
the women.",joseph
"I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.",joseph
Heavens!,joseph
"Well, you see, the notion drove me.",joseph
"I had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul.",joseph
She wrote: 'It will be delightful.,joseph
"I am ready to do
anything, anything for you.",joseph
It is a glorious idea.,joseph
"I know the wife of a
very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,' &c., &c. She was determined to make no end of fuss
to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.",joseph
"""I got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick.",joseph
"It appears
the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed
in a scuffle with the natives.",joseph
"This was my chance, and it made me the
more anxious to go.",joseph
"It was only months and months afterwards, when I
made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the
original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens.",joseph
"Yes,
two black hens.",joseph
"Fresleven--that was the fellow's name, a Dane--thought
himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to
hammer the chief of the village with a stick.",joseph
"Oh, it didn't surprise
me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that
Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two
legs.",joseph
"No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out
there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the
need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way.",joseph
"Therefore he
whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people
watched him, thunderstruck, till some man,--I was told the chief's
son,--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab
with a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between
the shoulder-blades.",joseph
"Then the whole population cleared into the forest,
expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,
the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of
the engineer, I believe.",joseph
"Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much
about Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes.",joseph
"I
couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to
meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough
to hide his bones.",joseph
They were all there.,joseph
"The supernatural being had not
been touched after he fell.",joseph
"And the village was deserted, the huts gaped
black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures.",joseph
"A calamity
had come to it, sure enough.",joseph
The people had vanished.,joseph
"Mad terror had
scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had
never returned.",joseph
What became of the hens I don't know either.,joseph
"I should
think the cause of progress got them, anyhow.",joseph
"However, through this
glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope
for it.",joseph
"""I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I
was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the
contract.",joseph
"In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me
think of a whited sepulcher.",joseph
Prejudice no doubt.,joseph
"I had no difficulty in
finding the Company's offices.",joseph
"It was the biggest thing in the town,
and everybody I met was full of it.",joseph
"They were going to run an over-sea
empire, and make no end of coin by trade.",joseph
"""A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable
windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting between
the stones, imposing carriage archways right and left, immense double
doors standing ponderously ajar.",joseph
"I slipped through one of these cracks,
went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and
opened the first door I came to.",joseph
"Two women, one fat and the other slim,
sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.",joseph
"The slim one got up
and walked straight at me--still knitting with downcast eyes--and only
just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a
somnambulist, stood still, and looked up.",joseph
"Her dress was as plain as an
umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me
into a waiting-room.",joseph
"I gave my name, and looked about.",joseph
"Deal table in
the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining
map, marked with all the colors of a rainbow.",joseph
"There was a vast amount of
red--good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work
is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of
orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly
pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer.",joseph
"However, I wasn't going
into any of these.",joseph
I was going into the yellow.,joseph
Dead in the center.,joseph
"And
the river was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake.",joseph
Ough!,joseph
"A door
opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate
expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the
sanctuary.",joseph
"Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in
the middle.",joseph
"From behind that structure came out an impression of pale
plumpness in a frock-coat.",joseph
The great man himself.,joseph
"He was five feet
six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many
millions.",joseph
"He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with
my French.",joseph
Bon voyage.,joseph
"﻿CHAPTER 1


He was an inch, perhaps two, under six feet, powerfully built, and he
advanced straight at you with a slight stoop of the shoulders, head
forward, and a fixed from-under stare which made you think of a charging
bull.",joseph
"His voice was deep, loud, and his manner displayed a kind of
dogged self-assertion which had nothing aggressive in it.",joseph
"It seemed
a necessity, and it was directed apparently as much at himself as at
anybody else.",joseph
"He was spotlessly neat, apparelled in immaculate white
from shoes to hat, and in the various Eastern ports where he got his
living as ship-chandler’s water-clerk he was very popular.",joseph
"A water-clerk need not pass an examination in anything under the sun,
but he must have Ability in the abstract and demonstrate it practically.",joseph
"His work consists in racing under sail, steam, or oars against other
water-clerks for any ship about to anchor, greeting her captain
cheerily, forcing upon him a card--the business card of the
ship-chandler--and on his first visit on shore piloting him firmly but
without ostentation to a vast, cavern-like shop which is full of things
that are eaten and drunk on board ship; where you can get everything
to make her seaworthy and beautiful, from a set of chain-hooks for her
cable to a book of gold-leaf for the carvings of her stern; and where
her commander is received like a brother by a ship-chandler he has never
seen before.",joseph
"There is a cool parlour, easy-chairs, bottles, cigars,
writing implements, a copy of harbour regulations, and a warmth of
welcome that melts the salt of a three months’ passage out of a seaman’s
heart.",joseph
"The connection thus begun is kept up, as long as the ship remains
in harbour, by the daily visits of the water-clerk.",joseph
"To the captain he
is faithful like a friend and attentive like a son, with the patience
of Job, the unselfish devotion of a woman, and the jollity of a boon
companion.",joseph
Later on the bill is sent in.,joseph
"It is a beautiful and humane
occupation.",joseph
Therefore good water-clerks are scarce.,joseph
"When a water-clerk
who possesses Ability in the abstract has also the advantage of having
been brought up to the sea, he is worth to his employer a lot of money
and some humouring.",joseph
"Jim had always good wages and as much humouring
as would have bought the fidelity of a fiend.",joseph
"Nevertheless, with black
ingratitude he would throw up the job suddenly and depart.",joseph
"To his
employers the reasons he gave were obviously inadequate.",joseph
"They said
‘Confounded fool!’ as soon as his back was turned.",joseph
"This was their
criticism on his exquisite sensibility.",joseph
"To the white men in the waterside business and to the captains of ships
he was just Jim--nothing more.",joseph
"He had, of course, another name, but he
was anxious that it should not be pronounced.",joseph
"His incognito, which had
as many holes as a sieve, was not meant to hide a personality but a
fact.",joseph
"When the fact broke through the incognito he would leave
suddenly the seaport where he happened to be at the time and go to
another--generally farther east.",joseph
"He kept to seaports because he was a
seaman in exile from the sea, and had Ability in the abstract, which is
good for no other work but that of a water-clerk.",joseph
"He retreated in good
order towards the rising sun, and the fact followed him casually but
inevitably.",joseph
"Thus in the course of years he was known successively in
Bombay, in Calcutta, in Rangoon, in Penang, in Batavia--and in each of
these halting-places was just Jim the water-clerk.",joseph
"Afterwards, when his
keen perception of the Intolerable drove him away for good from seaports
and white men, even into the virgin forest, the Malays of the jungle
village, where he had elected to conceal his deplorable faculty, added a
word to the monosyllable of his incognito.",joseph
"They called him Tuan Jim: as
one might say--Lord Jim.",joseph
Originally he came from a parsonage.,joseph
"Many commanders of fine
merchant-ships come from these abodes of piety and peace.",joseph
"Jim’s father
possessed such certain knowledge of the Unknowable as made for the
righteousness of people in cottages without disturbing the ease of mind
of those whom an unerring Providence enables to live in mansions.",joseph
"The
little church on a hill had the mossy greyness of a rock seen through a
ragged screen of leaves.",joseph
"It had stood there for centuries, but the trees
around probably remembered the laying of the first stone.",joseph
"Below, the
red front of the rectory gleamed with a warm tint in the midst of
grass-plots, flower-beds, and fir-trees, with an orchard at the back,
a paved stable-yard to the left, and the sloping glass of greenhouses
tacked along a wall of bricks.",joseph
"The living had belonged to the family for
generations; but Jim was one of five sons, and when after a course of
light holiday literature his vocation for the sea had declared itself,
he was sent at once to a ‘training-ship for officers of the mercantile
marine.’

He learned there a little trigonometry and how to cross top-gallant
yards.",joseph
He was generally liked.,joseph
"He had the third place in navigation
and pulled stroke in the first cutter.",joseph
"Having a steady head with an
excellent physique, he was very smart aloft.",joseph
"His station was in the
fore-top, and often from there he looked down, with the contempt of a
man destined to shine in the midst of dangers, at the peaceful multitude
of roofs cut in two by the brown tide of the stream, while scattered
on the outskirts of the surrounding plain the factory chimneys rose
perpendicular against a grimy sky, each slender like a pencil, and
belching out smoke like a volcano.",joseph
"He could see the big ships departing,
the broad-beamed ferries constantly on the move, the little boats
floating far below his feet, with the hazy splendour of the sea in the
distance, and the hope of a stirring life in the world of adventure.",joseph
"On the lower deck in the babel of two hundred voices he would forget
himself, and beforehand live in his mind the sea-life of light
literature.",joseph
"He saw himself saving people from sinking ships, cutting
away masts in a hurricane, swimming through a surf with a line; or as a
lonely castaway, barefooted and half naked, walking on uncovered reefs
in search of shellfish to stave off starvation.",joseph
"He confronted savages on
tropical shores, quelled mutinies on the high seas, and in a small boat
upon the ocean kept up the hearts of despairing men--always an example
of devotion to duty, and as unflinching as a hero in a book.",joseph
‘Something’s up.,joseph
"Come along.’

He leaped to his feet.",joseph
The boys were streaming up the ladders.,joseph
"Above
could be heard a great scurrying about and shouting, and when he got
through the hatchway he stood still--as if confounded.",joseph
It was the dusk of a winter’s day.,joseph
"The gale had freshened since noon,
stopping the traffic on the river, and now blew with the strength of a
hurricane in fitful bursts that boomed like salvoes of great guns firing
over the ocean.",joseph
"The rain slanted in sheets that flicked and subsided,
and between whiles Jim had threatening glimpses of the tumbling tide,
the small craft jumbled and tossing along the shore, the motionless
buildings in the driving mist, the broad ferry-boats pitching
ponderously at anchor, the vast landing-stages heaving up and down and
smothered in sprays.",joseph
The next gust seemed to blow all this away.,joseph
"The
air was full of flying water.",joseph
"There was a fierce purpose in the gale, a
furious earnestness in the screech of the wind, in the brutal tumult of
earth and sky, that seemed directed at him, and made him hold his breath
in awe.",joseph
He stood still.,joseph
It seemed to him he was whirled around.,joseph
He was jostled.,joseph
‘Man the cutter!’ Boys rushed past him.,joseph
"A coaster
running in for shelter had crashed through a schooner at anchor, and one
of the ship’s instructors had seen the accident.",joseph
"A mob of boys clambered
on the rails, clustered round the davits.",joseph
‘Collision.,joseph
Just ahead of us.,joseph
"Mr. Symons saw it.’ A push made him stagger against the mizzen-mast, and
he caught hold of a rope.",joseph
"The old training-ship chained to her moorings
quivered all over, bowing gently head to wind, and with her scanty
rigging humming in a deep bass the breathless song of her youth at sea.",joseph
"‘Lower away!’ He saw the boat, manned, drop swiftly below the rail,
and rushed after her.",joseph
He heard a splash.,joseph
"‘Let go; clear the falls!’ He
leaned over.",joseph
The river alongside seethed in frothy streaks.,joseph
"The cutter
could be seen in the falling darkness under the spell of tide and wind,
that for a moment held her bound, and tossing abreast of the ship.",joseph
"A yelling voice in her reached him faintly: ‘Keep stroke, you young
whelps, if you want to save anybody!",joseph
"Keep stroke!’ And suddenly she
lifted high her bow, and, leaping with raised oars over a wave, broke
the spell cast upon her by the wind and tide.",joseph
Jim felt his shoulder gripped firmly.,joseph
"‘Too late, youngster.’ The captain
of the ship laid a restraining hand on that boy, who seemed on the
point of leaping overboard, and Jim looked up with the pain of conscious
defeat in his eyes.",joseph
The captain smiled sympathetically.,joseph
"‘Better luck
next time.",joseph
"This will teach you to be smart.’

A shrill cheer greeted the cutter.",joseph
"She came dancing back half full of
water, and with two exhausted men washing about on her bottom boards.",joseph
"The tumult and the menace of wind and sea now appeared very contemptible
to Jim, increasing the regret of his awe at their inefficient menace.",joseph
Now he knew what to think of it.,joseph
"It seemed to him he cared nothing for
the gale.",joseph
He could affront greater perils.,joseph
"He would do so--better than
anybody.",joseph
Not a particle of fear was left.,joseph
"Nevertheless he brooded apart
that evening while the bowman of the cutter--a boy with a face like
a girl’s and big grey eyes--was the hero of the lower deck.",joseph
"Eager
questioners crowded round him.",joseph
"He narrated: ‘I just saw his head
bobbing, and I dashed my boat-hook in the water.",joseph
"It caught in his
breeches and I nearly went overboard, as I thought I would, only old
Symons let go the tiller and grabbed my legs--the boat nearly swamped.",joseph
Old Symons is a fine old chap.,joseph
"I don’t mind a bit him being grumpy with
us.",joseph
"He swore at me all the time he held my leg, but that was only his
way of telling me to stick to the boat-hook.",joseph
"Old Symons is awfully
excitable--isn’t he?",joseph
"No--not the little fair chap--the other, the big
one with a beard.",joseph
"When we pulled him in he groaned, “Oh, my leg!",joseph
"oh,
my leg!” and turned up his eyes.",joseph
"Fancy such a big chap fainting like
a girl.",joseph
"Would any of you fellows faint for a jab with a boat-hook?--I
wouldn’t.",joseph
"It went into his leg so far.’ He showed the boat-hook, which
he had carried below for the purpose, and produced a sensation.",joseph
"‘No,
silly!",joseph
It was not his flesh that held him--his breeches did.,joseph
"Lots of
blood, of course.’

Jim thought it a pitiful display of vanity.",joseph
"The gale had ministered to
a heroism as spurious as its own pretence of terror.",joseph
"He felt angry with
the brutal tumult of earth and sky for taking him unawares and checking
unfairly a generous readiness for narrow escapes.",joseph
"Otherwise he was
rather glad he had not gone into the cutter, since a lower achievement
had served the turn.",joseph
"He had enlarged his knowledge more than those who
had done the work.",joseph
"When all men flinched, then--he felt sure--he alone
would know how to deal with the spurious menace of wind and seas.",joseph
"He
knew what to think of it.",joseph
"Seen dispassionately, it seemed contemptible.",joseph
"He could detect no trace of emotion in himself, and the final effect of
a staggering event was that, unnoticed and apart from the noisy crowd of
boys, he exulted with fresh certitude in his avidity for adventure, and
in a sense of many-sided courage.",joseph
"CHAPTER 2


After two years of training he went to sea, and entering the regions so
well known to his imagination, found them strangely barren of adventure.",joseph
He made many voyages.,joseph
"He knew the magic monotony of existence between
sky and water: he had to bear the criticism of men, the exactions of the
sea, and the prosaic severity of the daily task that gives bread--but
whose only reward is in the perfect love of the work.",joseph
"This reward eluded
him.",joseph
"Yet he could not go back, because there is nothing more enticing,
disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea.",joseph
"Besides, his
prospects were good.",joseph
"He was gentlemanly, steady, tractable, with a
thorough knowledge of his duties; and in time, when yet very young, he
became chief mate of a fine ship, without ever having been tested by
those events of the sea that show in the light of day the inner worth of
a man, the edge of his temper, and the fibre of his stuff; that reveal
the quality of his resistance and the secret truth of his pretences, not
only to others but also to himself.",joseph
"Only once in all that time he had again a glimpse of the earnestness in
the anger of the sea.",joseph
"That truth is not so often made apparent as people
might think.",joseph
"There are many shades in the danger of adventures and
gales, and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of
facts a sinister violence of intention--that indefinable something which
forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man, that this complication
of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose
of malice, with a strength beyond control, with an unbridled cruelty
that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear, the pain of his
fatigue and his longing for rest: which means to smash, to destroy, to
annihilate all he has seen, known, loved, enjoyed, or hated; all that is
priceless and necessary--the sunshine, the memories, the future; which
means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by
the simple and appalling act of taking his life.",joseph
"Jim, disabled by a falling spar at the beginning of a week of which his
Scottish captain used to say afterwards, ‘Man!",joseph
"it’s a pairfect meeracle
to me how she lived through it!’ spent many days stretched on his back,
dazed, battered, hopeless, and tormented as if at the bottom of an
abyss of unrest.",joseph
"He did not care what the end would be, and in his lucid
moments overvalued his indifference.",joseph
"The danger, when not seen, has
the imperfect vagueness of human thought.",joseph
"The fear grows shadowy; and
Imagination, the enemy of men, the father of all terrors, unstimulated,
sinks to rest in the dullness of exhausted emotion.",joseph
"Jim saw nothing
but the disorder of his tossed cabin.",joseph
"He lay there battened down in the
midst of a small devastation, and felt secretly glad he had not to go on
deck.",joseph
"But now and again an uncontrollable rush of anguish would grip
him bodily, make him gasp and writhe under the blankets, and then the
unintelligent brutality of an existence liable to the agony of such
sensations filled him with a despairing desire to escape at any cost.",joseph
"Then fine weather returned, and he thought no more about It.",joseph
"His lameness, however, persisted, and when the ship arrived at an
Eastern port he had to go to the hospital.",joseph
"His recovery was slow, and he
was left behind.",joseph
"There were only two other patients in the white men’s ward: the purser
of a gunboat, who had broken his leg falling down a hatchway; and a kind
of railway contractor from a neighbouring province, afflicted by
some mysterious tropical disease, who held the doctor for an ass, and
indulged in secret debaucheries of patent medicine which his Tamil
servant used to smuggle in with unwearied devotion.",joseph
"They told each other
the story of their lives, played cards a little, or, yawning and in
pyjamas, lounged through the day in easy-chairs without saying a word.",joseph
"The hospital stood on a hill, and a gentle breeze entering through the
windows, always flung wide open, brought into the bare room the softness
of the sky, the languor of the earth, the bewitching breath of the
Eastern waters.",joseph
"There were perfumes in it, suggestions of infinite
repose, the gift of endless dreams.",joseph
"Jim looked every day over the
thickets of gardens, beyond the roofs of the town, over the fronds of
palms growing on the shore, at that roadstead which is a thoroughfare
to the East,--at the roadstead dotted by garlanded islets, lighted by
festal sunshine, its ships like toys, its brilliant activity resembling
a holiday pageant, with the eternal serenity of the Eastern sky overhead
and the smiling peace of the Eastern seas possessing the space as far as
the horizon.",joseph
"Directly he could walk without a stick, he descended into the town to
look for some opportunity to get home.",joseph
"Nothing offered just then, and,
while waiting, he associated naturally with the men of his calling in
the port.",joseph
These were of two kinds.,joseph
"Some, very few and seen there but
seldom, led mysterious lives, had preserved an undefaced energy with the
temper of buccaneers and the eyes of dreamers.",joseph
"They appeared to live
in a crazy maze of plans, hopes, dangers, enterprises, ahead of
civilisation, in the dark places of the sea; and their death was the
only event of their fantastic existence that seemed to have a reasonable
certitude of achievement.",joseph
"The majority were men who, like himself,
thrown there by some accident, had remained as officers of country
ships.",joseph
"They had now a horror of the home service, with its harder
conditions, severer view of duty, and the hazard of stormy oceans.",joseph
"They
were attuned to the eternal peace of Eastern sky and sea.",joseph
"They
loved short passages, good deck-chairs, large native crews, and the
distinction of being white.",joseph
"They shuddered at the thought of hard work,
and led precariously easy lives, always on the verge of dismissal,
always on the verge of engagement, serving Chinamen, Arabs,
half-castes--would have served the devil himself had he made it easy
enough.",joseph
"They talked everlastingly of turns of luck: how So-and-so got
charge of a boat on the coast of China--a soft thing; how this one had
an easy billet in Japan somewhere, and that one was doing well in the
Siamese navy; and in all they said--in their actions, in their looks, in
their persons--could be detected the soft spot, the place of decay, the
determination to lounge safely through existence.",joseph
"To Jim that gossiping crowd, viewed as seamen, seemed at first more
unsubstantial than so many shadows.",joseph
"But at length he found a fascination
in the sight of those men, in their appearance of doing so well on
such a small allowance of danger and toil.",joseph
"In time, beside the original
disdain there grew up slowly another sentiment; and suddenly, giving up
the idea of going home, he took a berth as chief mate of the Patna.",joseph
"The Patna was a local steamer as old as the hills, lean like a
greyhound, and eaten up with rust worse than a condemned water-tank.",joseph
"She
was owned by a Chinaman, chartered by an Arab, and commanded by a sort
of renegade New South Wales German, very anxious to curse publicly
his native country, but who, apparently on the strength of Bismarck’s
victorious policy, brutalised all those he was not afraid of, and wore a
‘blood-and-iron’ air,’ combined with a purple nose and a red moustache.",joseph
"After she had been painted outside and whitewashed inside, eight hundred
pilgrims (more or less) were driven on board of her as she lay with
steam up alongside a wooden jetty.",joseph
"They streamed aboard over three gangways, they streamed in urged by
faith and the hope of paradise, they streamed in with a continuous tramp
and shuffle of bare feet, without a word, a murmur, or a look back; and
when clear of confining rails spread on all sides over the deck, flowed
forward and aft, overflowed down the yawning hatchways, filled the inner
recesses of the ship--like water filling a cistern, like water flowing
into crevices and crannies, like water rising silently even with the
rim.",joseph
"Eight hundred men and women with faith and hopes, with affections
and memories, they had collected there, coming from north and south
and from the outskirts of the East, after treading the jungle paths,
descending the rivers, coasting in praus along the shallows, crossing in
small canoes from island to island, passing through suffering, meeting
strange sights, beset by strange fears, upheld by one desire.",joseph
"They
came from solitary huts in the wilderness, from populous campongs, from
villages by the sea.",joseph
"At the call of an idea they had left their forests,
their clearings, the protection of their rulers, their prosperity,
their poverty, the surroundings of their youth and the graves of their
fathers.",joseph
"They came covered with dust, with sweat, with grime, with
rags--the strong men at the head of family parties, the lean old men
pressing forward without hope of return; young boys with fearless eyes
glancing curiously, shy little girls with tumbled long hair; the timid
women muffled up and clasping to their breasts, wrapped in loose ends of
soiled head-cloths, their sleeping babies, the unconscious pilgrims of
an exacting belief.",joseph
"‘Look at dese cattle,’ said the German skipper to his new chief mate.",joseph
"An Arab, the leader of that pious voyage, came last.",joseph
"He walked slowly
aboard, handsome and grave in his white gown and large turban.",joseph
"A string
of servants followed, loaded with his luggage; the Patna cast off and
backed away from the wharf.",joseph
"She was headed between two small islets, crossed obliquely the
anchoring-ground of sailing-ships, swung through half a circle in the
shadow of a hill, then ranged close to a ledge of foaming reefs.",joseph
"The
Arab, standing up aft, recited aloud the prayer of travellers by sea.",joseph
"He invoked the favour of the Most High upon that journey, implored His
blessing on men’s toil and on the secret purposes of their hearts; the
steamer pounded in the dusk the calm water of the Strait; and far astern
of the pilgrim ship a screw-pile lighthouse, planted by unbelievers on
a treacherous shoal, seemed to wink at her its eye of flame, as if in
derision of her errand of faith.",joseph
"She cleared the Strait, crossed the bay, continued on her way through
the ‘One-degree’ passage.",joseph
"She held on straight for the Red Sea under a
serene sky, under a sky scorching and unclouded, enveloped in a fulgor
of sunshine that killed all thought, oppressed the heart, withered all
impulses of strength and energy.",joseph
"And under the sinister splendour of
that sky the sea, blue and profound, remained still, without a stir,
without a ripple, without a wrinkle--viscous, stagnant, dead.",joseph
"The
Patna, with a slight hiss, passed over that plain, luminous and smooth,
unrolled a black ribbon of smoke across the sky, left behind her on the
water a white ribbon of foam that vanished at once, like the phantom of
a track drawn upon a lifeless sea by the phantom of a steamer.",joseph
"Every morning the sun, as if keeping pace in his revolutions with the
progress of the pilgrimage, emerged with a silent burst of light exactly
at the same distance astern of the ship, caught up with her at noon,
pouring the concentrated fire of his rays on the pious purposes of the
men, glided past on his descent, and sank mysteriously into the sea
evening after evening, preserving the same distance ahead of her
advancing bows.",joseph
"The five whites on board lived amidships, isolated from
the human cargo.",joseph
"The awnings covered the deck with a white roof from
stem to stern, and a faint hum, a low murmur of sad voices, alone
revealed the presence of a crowd of people upon the great blaze of the
ocean.",joseph
"Such were the days, still, hot, heavy, disappearing one by one
into the past, as if falling into an abyss for ever open in the wake
of the ship; and the ship, lonely under a wisp of smoke, held on her
steadfast way black and smouldering in a luminous immensity, as if
scorched by a flame flicked at her from a heaven without pity.",joseph
The nights descended on her like a benediction.,joseph
"CHAPTER 3


A marvellous stillness pervaded the world, and the stars, together with
the serenity of their rays, seemed to shed upon the earth the assurance
of everlasting security.",joseph
"The young moon recurved, and shining low in the
west, was like a slender shaving thrown up from a bar of gold, and the
Arabian Sea, smooth and cool to the eye like a sheet of ice, extended
its perfect level to the perfect circle of a dark horizon.",joseph
"The propeller
turned without a check, as though its beat had been part of the scheme
of a safe universe; and on each side of the Patna two deep folds of
water, permanent and sombre on the unwrinkled shimmer, enclosed within
their straight and diverging ridges a few white swirls of foam bursting
in a low hiss, a few wavelets, a few ripples, a few undulations that,
left behind, agitated the surface of the sea for an instant after the
passage of the ship, subsided splashing gently, calmed down at last
into the circular stillness of water and sky with the black speck of the
moving hull remaining everlastingly in its centre.",joseph
"Jim on the bridge was penetrated by the great certitude of unbounded
safety and peace that could be read on the silent aspect of nature like
the certitude of fostering love upon the placid tenderness of a mother’s
face.",joseph
"Below the roof of awnings, surrendered to the wisdom of white men
and to their courage, trusting the power of their unbelief and the iron
shell of their fire-ship, the pilgrims of an exacting faith slept
on mats, on blankets, on bare planks, on every deck, in all the dark
corners, wrapped in dyed cloths, muffled in soiled rags, with their
heads resting on small bundles, with their faces pressed to bent
forearms: the men, the women, the children; the old with the young, the
decrepit with the lusty--all equal before sleep, death’s brother.",joseph
"A draught of air, fanned from forward by the speed of the ship, passed
steadily through the long gloom between the high bulwarks, swept over
the rows of prone bodies; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung
short here and there under the ridge-poles, and in the blurred circles
of light thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration
of the ship appeared a chin upturned, two closed eyelids, a dark hand
with silver rings, a meagre limb draped in a torn covering, a head bent
back, a naked foot, a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself
to the knife.",joseph
"The well-to-do had made for their families shelters with
heavy boxes and dusty mats; the poor reposed side by side with all they
had on earth tied up in a rag under their heads; the lone old men slept,
with drawn-up legs, upon their prayer-carpets, with their hands over
their ears and one elbow on each side of the face; a father, his
shoulders up and his knees under his forehead, dozed dejectedly by a
boy who slept on his back with tousled hair and one arm commandingly
extended; a woman covered from head to foot, like a corpse, with a piece
of white sheeting, had a naked child in the hollow of each arm; the
Arab’s belongings, piled right aft, made a heavy mound of broken
outlines, with a cargo-lamp swung above, and a great confusion of
vague forms behind: gleams of paunchy brass pots, the foot-rest of a
deck-chair, blades of spears, the straight scabbard of an old sword
leaning against a heap of pillows, the spout of a tin coffee-pot.",joseph
"The
patent log on the taffrail periodically rang a single tinkling stroke
for every mile traversed on an errand of faith.",joseph
"Above the mass of
sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated, the exhalation of a
troubled dream; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in the
depths of the ship, the harsh scrape of a shovel, the violent slam of a
furnace-door, exploded brutally, as if the men handling the mysterious
things below had their breasts full of fierce anger: while the slim high
hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead, without a sway of her bare
masts, cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the
inaccessible serenity of the sky.",joseph
"Jim paced athwart, and his footsteps in the vast silence were loud to
his own ears, as if echoed by the watchful stars: his eyes, roaming
about the line of the horizon, seemed to gaze hungrily into the
unattainable, and did not see the shadow of the coming event.",joseph
"The only
shadow on the sea was the shadow of the black smoke pouring heavily from
the funnel its immense streamer, whose end was constantly dissolving in
the air.",joseph
"Two Malays, silent and almost motionless, steered, one on each
side of the wheel, whose brass rim shone fragmentarily in the oval
of light thrown out by the binnacle.",joseph
"Now and then a hand, with black
fingers alternately letting go and catching hold of revolving spokes,
appeared in the illumined part; the links of wheel-chains ground heavily
in the grooves of the barrel.",joseph
"Jim would glance at the compass, would
glance around the unattainable horizon, would stretch himself till his
joints cracked, with a leisurely twist of the body, in the very excess
of well-being; and, as if made audacious by the invincible aspect of the
peace, he felt he cared for nothing that could happen to him to the end
of his days.",joseph
"From time to time he glanced idly at a chart pegged
out with four drawing-pins on a low three-legged table abaft the
steering-gear case.",joseph
"The sheet of paper portraying the depths of the sea
presented a shiny surface under the light of a bull’s-eye lamp lashed to
a stanchion, a surface as level and smooth as the glimmering surface of
the waters.",joseph
"Parallel rulers with a pair of dividers reposed on it; the
ship’s position at last noon was marked with a small black cross, and
the straight pencil-line drawn firmly as far as Perim figured the course
of the ship--the path of souls towards the holy place, the promise of
salvation, the reward of eternal life--while the pencil with its sharp
end touching the Somali coast lay round and still like a naked ship’s
spar floating in the pool of a sheltered dock.",joseph
"‘How steady she goes,’
thought Jim with wonder, with something like gratitude for this high
peace of sea and sky.",joseph
"At such times his thoughts would be full of
valorous deeds: he loved these dreams and the success of his imaginary
achievements.",joseph
"They were the best parts of life, its secret truth, its
hidden reality.",joseph
"They had a gorgeous virility, the charm of vagueness,
they passed before him with an heroic tread; they carried his soul away
with them and made it drunk with the divine philtre of an unbounded
confidence in itself.",joseph
There was nothing he could not face.,joseph
"He was so
pleased with the idea that he smiled, keeping perfunctorily his eyes
ahead; and when he happened to glance back he saw the white streak of
the wake drawn as straight by the ship’s keel upon the sea as the black
line drawn by the pencil upon the chart.",joseph
"The ash-buckets racketed, clanking up and down the stoke-hold
ventilators, and this tin-pot clatter warned him the end of his watch
was near.",joseph
"He sighed with content, with regret as well at having to
part from that serenity which fostered the adventurous freedom of his
thoughts.",joseph
"He was a little sleepy too, and felt a pleasurable languor
running through every limb as though all the blood in his body had
turned to warm milk.",joseph
"His skipper had come up noiselessly, in pyjamas and
with his sleeping-jacket flung wide open.",joseph
"Red of face, only half awake,
the left eye partly closed, the right staring stupid and glassy, he hung
his big head over the chart and scratched his ribs sleepily.",joseph
"There was
something obscene in the sight of his naked flesh.",joseph
"His bared breast
glistened soft and greasy as though he had sweated out his fat in his
sleep.",joseph
"﻿I


After entering at break of day the inner roadstead of the Port of
Toulon, exchanging several loud hails with one of the guardboats of the
Fleet, which directed him where he was to take up his berth,
Master-Gunner Peyrol let go the anchor of the sea-worn and battered ship
in his charge, between the arsenal and the town, in full view of the
principal quay.",joseph
"The course of his life, which in the opinion of any
ordinary person might have been regarded as full of marvellous incidents
(only he himself had never marvelled at them) had rendered him
undemonstrative to such a degree, that he did not even let out a sigh of
relief at the rumble of the chain.",joseph
"And yet it ended a most anxious six
months of knocking about at sea with valuable merchandize in a damaged
hull, most of the time on short rations, always on the lookout for
English cruisers, once or twice on the verge of shipwreck and more than
once on the verge of capture.",joseph
"But as to that, old Peyrol had made up his
mind from the first to blow up his valuable charge--unemotionally, for
such was his character, formed under the sun of the Indian seas in
lawless contests with his kind for a little loot that vanished as soon
as grasped, but mainly for bare life almost as precarious to hold
through its ups and downs, and which now had lasted for fifty-eight
years.",joseph
"While his crew of half-starved scarecrows, hard as nails and ravenous as
so many wolves for the delights of the shore, swarmed aloft to furl the
sails nearly as thin and as patched as the grimy shirts on their backs,
Peyrol took a survey of the quay.",joseph
"Groups were forming along its whole
stretch to gaze at the new arrival.",joseph
"Peyrol noted particularly a good
many men in red caps and said to himself: “Here they are.” Amongst the
crews of ships that had brought the tricolour into the seas of the East,
there were hundreds professing sans-culotte principles; boastful and
declamatory beggars he had thought them.",joseph
"But now he was beholding the
shore breed.",joseph
Those who had made the Revolution safe.,joseph
The real thing.,joseph
"Peyrol after taking a good long look, went below into his cabin to make
himself ready to go ashore.",joseph
"He shaved his big cheeks with a real English razor, looted years ago
from an officer’s cabin in an English East Indiaman, captured by a ship
he was serving in then.",joseph
"He put on a white shirt, a short blue jacket
with metal buttons and a high roll-collar, a pair of white trousers
which he fastened with a red bandana handkerchief, by way of a belt.",joseph
"With a black, shiny low-crowned hat on his head he made a very
creditable prize-master.",joseph
"He beckoned from the poop to a boatman and got
himself rowed to the quay.",joseph
By that time the crowd had grown to a large size.,joseph
"Peyrol’s eyes ranged
over it with no great apparent interest, though it was a fact that he
had never in all his man’s life seen so many idle white people massed
together to stare at a sailor.",joseph
"He had been a rover of the outer seas;
he had grown into a stranger to his native country.",joseph
"During the few
minutes it took the boatman to row him to the steps, he felt like a
navigator about to land on a newly discovered shore.",joseph
On putting his foot on it he was mobbed.,joseph
"The arrival of a prize made by
a squadron of the Republic in distant seas was not an everyday
occurrence in Toulon.",joseph
The wildest rumours had been already set flying.,joseph
"Peyrol elbowed himself through the crowd somehow, but it continued to
move after him.",joseph
"A voice cried out, “Where do you come from, citoyen?”
“From the other side of the world,” Peyrol boomed out.",joseph
He did not get rid of his followers till the door of the Port Office.,joseph
"There he reported himself to the proper officials as master of a prize
taken off the Cape by Citoyen Renaud, Commander-in-Chief of the
Republican Squadron in the Indian Seas.",joseph
"He had been ordered to make for
Dunkerque but, said he, having been chased by the sacrés Anglais three
times in a fortnight between Cape Verde and Cape Spartel, he had made up
his mind to run into the Mediterranean where, he had understood from a
Danish brig he had met at sea, there were no English men-of-war just
then.",joseph
"And here he was; and there were his ship’s papers and his own
papers and everything in order.",joseph
"He mentioned also that he was tired of
rolling about the seas, and that he longed for a period of repose on
shore.",joseph
"But till all the legal business was settled he remained in Toulon
roaming about the streets at a deliberate gait, enjoying general
consideration as Citizen Peyrol, and looking everybody coldly in the
eye.",joseph
"His reticence about his past was of that kind which starts a lot of
mysterious stories about a man.",joseph
"No doubt the maritime authorities of
Toulon had a less cloudy idea of Peyrol’s past, though it need not
necessarily have been more exact.",joseph
"In the various offices connected with
the sea where his duties took him, the wretched scribes, and even some
of the chiefs, looked very hard at him as he went in and out, dressed
very neatly, and always with his cudgel, which he used to leave outside
the door of private offices when called in for an interview with one or
another of the “gold-laced lot.” Having, however, cut off his queue and
got in touch with some prominent patriots of the Jacobin type, Peyrol
cared little for people’s stares and whispers.",joseph
"The person that came
nearest to trying his composure, was a certain naval captain with a
patch over one eye and a very threadbare uniform coat, who was doing
some administrative work at the Port Office.",joseph
"That officer, looking up
from some papers, remarked brusquely, “As a matter of fact you have been
the best part of your life skimming the seas, if the truth were known.",joseph
"You must have been a deserter from the Navy at one time, whatever you
may call yourself now.”

There was not a quiver on the large cheeks of the gunner Peyrol.",joseph
"“If there was anything of the sort it was in the time of kings and
aristocrats,” he said steadily.",joseph
"“And now I have brought in a prize, and
a service letter from Citizen Renaud, commanding in the Indian seas.",joseph
"I
can also give you the names of good Republicans in this town who know my
sentiments.",joseph
Nobody can say I was ever anti-revolutionary in my life.,joseph
"I
knocked about the Eastern seas for forty-five years--that’s true.",joseph
"But
let me observe that it was the seamen who stayed at home that let the
English into the Port of Toulon.” He paused for a moment and then added,
“When one thinks of that, Citoyen Commandant, any little slips I and
fellows of my kind may have made five thousand leagues from here and
twenty years ago cannot have much importance in these times of equality
and fraternity.”

“As to fraternity,” remarked the post-captain in the shabby coat, “the
only one you are familiar with is the brotherhood of the coast, I should
say.”

“Everybody in the Indian Ocean except milksops and youngsters had to
be,” said the untroubled Citizen Peyrol.",joseph
"“And we practised republican
principles long before a republic was thought of; for the Brothers of
the Coast were all equal and elected their own chiefs.”

“They were an abominable lot of lawless ruffians,” remarked the officer
venomously, leaning back in his chair.",joseph
"“You will not dare to deny that.”

Citizen Peyrol refused to take up a defensive attitude.",joseph
"He merely
mentioned in a neutral tone that he had delivered his trust to the Port
Office all right, and as to his character he had a certificate of civism
from his section.",joseph
He was a patriot and entitled to his discharge.,joseph
"After
being dismissed by a nod he took up his cudgel outside the door and
walked out of the building with the calmness of rectitude.",joseph
"His large
face of the Roman type betrayed nothing to the wretched quill-drivers,
who whispered on his passage.",joseph
"As he went along the streets, he looked as
usual everybody in the eye; but that very same evening he vanished from
Toulon.",joseph
It wasn’t that he was afraid of anything.,joseph
"His mind was as calm
as the natural set of his florid face.",joseph
"Nobody could know what his forty
years or more of sea life had been, unless he told them himself.",joseph
"And of
that he didn’t mean to tell more than what he had told the inquisitive
captain with the patch over one eye.",joseph
"But he didn’t want any bother for
certain other reasons; and more than anything else he didn’t want to be
sent perhaps to serve in the fleet now fitting out in Toulon.",joseph
"So at dusk
he passed through the gate on the road to Fréjus in a high two-wheeled
cart belonging to a well-known farmer whose habitation lay that way.",joseph
"His
personal belongings were brought down and piled up on the tailboard of
the cart by some ragamuffin patriots whom he engaged in the street for
that purpose.",joseph
"The only indiscretion he committed was to pay them for
their trouble with a large handful of assignats.",joseph
"From such a prosperous
seaman, however, this generosity was not so very compromising.",joseph
"He
himself got into the cart over the wheel, with such slow and ponderous
movements, that the friendly farmer felt called upon to remark: “Ah, we
are not so young as we used to be--you and I.” “I have also an awkward
wound,” said Citizen Peyrol sitting down heavily.",joseph
"And so from farmer’s cart to farmer’s cart, getting lifts all along,
jogging in a cloud of dust between stone walls and through little
villages well known to him from his boyhood’s days, in a landscape of
stony hills, pale rocks, and dusty green of olive trees, Citizen Peyrol
went on unmolested till he got down clumsily in the yard of an inn on
the outskirts of the town of Hyères.",joseph
The sun was setting to his right.,joseph
"Near a clump of dark pines with blood-red trunks in the sunset Peyrol
perceived a rutty track branching off in the direction of the sea.",joseph
At that spot Citizen Peyrol had made up his mind to leave the high road.,joseph
"Every feature of the country with the darkly wooded rises, the barren
flat expanse of stones and sombre bushes to his left, appealed to him
with a sort of strange familiarity, because they had remained unchanged
since the days of his boyhood.",joseph
"The very cartwheel tracks scored deep
into the stony ground had kept their physiognomy; and far away, like a
blue thread, there was the sea of the Hyères roadstead with a lumpy
indigo swelling still beyond--which was the island of Porquerolles.",joseph
"He
had an idea that he had been born on Porquerolles, but he really did not
know.",joseph
The notion of a father was absent from his mentality.,joseph
"What he
remembered of his parents was a tall, lean, brown woman in rags, who was
his mother.",joseph
"But then they were working together at a farm which was on
the mainland.",joseph
"He had fragmentary memories of her shaking down olives,
picking stones out of a field, or handling a manure fork like a man,
tireless and fierce, with wisps of greyish hair flying about her bony
face; and of himself running barefooted in connection with a flock of
turkeys, with hardly any clothes on his back.",joseph
"At night, by the farmer’s
favour, they were permitted to sleep in a sort of ruinous byre built of
stones and with only half a roof on it, lying side by side on some old
straw on the ground.",joseph
"And it was on a bundle of straw that his mother had
tossed ill for two days and had died in the night.",joseph
"In the darkness, her
silence, her cold face had given him an awful scare.",joseph
"He supposed they
had buried her but he didn’t know, because he had rushed out
terror-struck, and never stopped till he got as far as a little place by
the sea called Almanarre, where he hid himself on board a tartane that
was lying there with no one on board.",joseph
"He went into the hold because he
was afraid of some dogs on shore.",joseph
"He found down there a heap of empty
sacks, which made a luxurious couch, and being exhausted went to sleep
like a stone.",joseph
"Some time during the night the crew came on board and the
tartane sailed for Marseilles.",joseph
"That was another awful scare--being
hauled out by the scruff of the neck on the deck and being asked who the
devil he was and what he was doing there.",joseph
"Only from that one he could
not run away.",joseph
"There was water all around him and the whole world,
including the coast not very far away, wobbled in a most alarming
manner.",joseph
"Three bearded men stood about him and he tried to explain to
them that he had been working at Peyrol’s.",joseph
Peyrol was the farmer’s name.,joseph
The boy didn’t know that he had one of his own.,joseph
"Moreover he didn’t know
very well how to talk to people, and they must have misunderstood him.",joseph
Thus the name of Peyrol stuck to him for life.,joseph
"There the memories of his native country stopped, overlaid by other
memories, with a multitude of impressions of endless oceans, of the
Mozambique Channel, of Arabs and negroes, of Madagascar, of the coast of
India, of islands and channels and reefs; of fights at sea, rows on
shore, desperate slaughter and desperate thirst, of all sorts of ships
one after another: merchant ships and frigates and privateers; of
reckless men and enormous sprees.",joseph
"In the course of years he had learned
to speak intelligibly and think connectedly, and even to read and write
after a fashion.",joseph
"The name of the farmer Peyrol attached to his person on
account of his inability to give a clear account of himself acquired a
sort of reputation, both openly, in the ports of the East and, secretly,
amongst the Brothers of the Coast, that strange fraternity with
something masonic and not a little piratical in its constitution.",joseph
"Round
the Cape of Storms, which is also the Cape of Good Hope, the words
Republic, Nation, Tyranny, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, and the
cult of the Supreme Being came floating on board ships from home: new
cries and new ideas which did not upset the slowly developed
intelligence of the gunner Peyrol.",joseph
"They seemed the invention of
landsmen, of whom the seaman Peyrol knew very little--nothing, so to
speak.",joseph
"Now after nearly fifty years of lawful and lawless sea-life
Citizen Peyrol, at the yard gate of the roadside inn, looked at the late
scene of his childhood.",joseph
"He looked at it without any animosity but a
little puzzled as to his bearings amongst the features of the land.",joseph
"“Yes, it must be somewhere in that direction,” he thought vaguely.",joseph
"Decidedly he would go no further along the high road.... A few yards
away the woman of the inn stood looking at him, impressed by the good
clothes, the great shaven cheeks, the well-to-do air of that seaman; and
suddenly Peyrol noticed her.",joseph
"With her anxious brown face, her grey
locks, and her rustic appearance she might have been his mother, as he
remembered her, only she wasn’t in rags.",joseph
“Hé!,joseph
"la mère,” hailed Peyrol.",joseph
"“Have you got a man to lend a hand with my
chest into the house?”

He looked so prosperous and so authoritative that she piped without
hesitation in a thin voice, “Mais oui, citoyen.",joseph
"He will be here in a
moment.”

In the dusk the clump of pines across the road looked very black against
the quiet clear sky; and Citizen Peyrol gazed at the scene of his young
misery with the greatest possible placidity.",joseph
"Here he was after nearly
fifty years, and to look at things it seemed like yesterday.",joseph
"He felt for
all this neither love nor resentment.",joseph
"He felt a little funny as it were,
and the funniest thing was the thought which crossed his mind that he
could indulge his fancy (if he had a mind to it) to buy up all this land
to the furthermost field, away over there where the track lost itself
sinking into the flats bordering the sea where the small rise at the end
of the Giens peninsula had assumed the appearance of a black cloud.",joseph
"“Tell me, my friend,” he said in his magisterial way to the farmhand
with a tousled head of hair who was awaiting his good pleasure, “doesn’t
this track lead to Almanarre?”

“Yes,” said the labourer, and Peyrol nodded.",joseph
"The man continued mouthing
his words slowly as if unused to speech.",joseph
"“To Almanarre and further too,
beyond the great pond right out to the end of the land, to Cape
Esterel.”

Peyrol was lending his big flat hairy ear.",joseph
"“If I had stayed in this
country,” he thought, “I would be talking like this fellow.” And aloud
he asked:

“Are there any houses there, at the end of the land?”

“Why, a hamlet, a hole, just a few houses round a church, and a farm
where at one time they would give you a glass of wine.”




II


Citizen Peyrol stayed at the inn-yard gate till the night had swallowed
up all those features of the land to which his eyes had clung as long as
the last gleams of daylight.",joseph
"And even after the last gleams had gone he
had remained for some time staring into the darkness, in which all he
could distinguish was the white road at his feet and the black heads of
pines where the cart track dipped towards the coast.",joseph
"He did not go
indoors till some carters who had been refreshing themselves had
departed with their big two-wheeled carts, piled up high with empty
wine-casks, in the direction of Fréjus.",joseph
"The fact that they did not
remain for the night pleased Peyrol.",joseph
"He ate his bit of supper alone, in
silence, and with a gravity which intimidated the old woman who had
aroused in him the memory of his mother.",joseph
"Having finished his pipe and
obtained a bit of candle in a tin candlestick, Citizen Peyrol went
heavily upstairs to rejoin his luggage.",joseph
"The crazy staircase shook and
groaned under his feet as though he had been carrying a burden.",joseph
"The
first thing he did was to close the shutters most carefully as though he
had been afraid of a breath of night air.",joseph
"Next he bolted the door of the
room.",joseph
"Then sitting on the floor, with the candlestick standing before
him between his widely straggled legs, he began to undress, flinging off
his coat and dragging his shirt hastily over his head.",joseph
"The secret of
his heavy movements was disclosed then in the fact that he had been
wearing next his bare skin--like a pious penitent his hair-shirt--a sort
of waistcoat made of two thicknesses of old sail-cloth and stitched all
over in the manner of a quilt with tarred twine.",joseph
"Three horn buttons
closed it in front.",joseph
"He undid them, and after he had slipped off the two
shoulder-straps which prevented this strange garment from sagging down
on his hips he started rolling it up.",joseph
"Notwithstanding all his care there
were during this operation several faint chinks of some metal which
could not have been lead.",joseph
"His bare torso thrown backwards and sustained by his rigid big arms
heavily tattooed on the white skin above the elbows, Peyrol drew a long
breath into his broad chest with a pepper and salt pelt down the
breastbone.",joseph
"And not only was the breast of Citizen Peyrol relieved to
the fullest of its athletic capacity, but a change had also come over
his large physiognomy on which the expression of severe stolidity had
been simply the result of physical discomfort.",joseph
"It isn’t a trifle to have
to carry girt about your ribs and hung from your shoulders a mass of
mixed foreign coins equal to sixty or seventy thousand francs in hard
cash; while as to the paper money of the Republic, Peyrol had had
already enough experience of it to estimate the equivalent in cartloads.",joseph
A thousand of them.,joseph
Perhaps two thousand.,joseph
"Enough in any case to justify
his flight of fancy, while looking at the countryside in the light of
the sunset, that what he had on him would buy all that soil from which
he had sprung: houses, woods, vines, olives, vegetable gardens, rocks
and salt lagoons--in fact, the whole landscape, including the animals
in it.",joseph
But Peyrol did not care for the land at all.,joseph
"He did not want to
own any part of the solid earth for which he had no love.",joseph
"All he wanted
from it was a quiet nook, an obscure corner out of men’s sight where he
could dig a hole unobserved.",joseph
"That would have to be done pretty soon, he thought.",joseph
"One could not live
for an indefinite number of days with a treasure strapped round one’s
chest.",joseph
"Meantime, an utter stranger in his native country the landing on
which was perhaps the biggest adventure in his adventurous life, he
threw his jacket over the rolled-up waistcoat and laid his head down on
it after extinguishing the candle.",joseph
The night was warm.,joseph
"The floor of the
room happened to be of planks, not of tiles.",joseph
"He was no stranger to that
sort of couch.",joseph
"With his cudgel laid ready at his hand Peyrol slept
soundly till the noises and the voices about the house and on the road
woke him up shortly after sunrise.",joseph
"He threw open the shutter, welcoming
the morning light and the morning breeze in the full enjoyment of
idleness which, to a seaman of his kind, is inseparable from the fact of
being on shore.",joseph
"There was nothing to trouble his thoughts; and though
his physiognomy was far from being vacant, it did not wear the aspect of
profound meditation.",joseph
"It had been by the merest accident that he had discovered during the
passage, in a secret recess within one of the lockers of his prize, two
bags of mixed coins: gold mohurs, Dutch ducats, Spanish pieces, English
guineas.",joseph
"After making that discovery he had suffered from no doubts
whatever.",joseph
"Loot, big or little, was a natural fact of his freebooter’s
life.",joseph
"And now when by the force of things he had become a master-gunner
of the Navy he was not going to give up his find to confounded landsmen,
mere sharks, hungry quill-drivers, who would put it in their own
pockets.",joseph
"As to imparting the intelligence to his crew (all bad
characters), he was much too wise to do anything of the kind.",joseph
"They would
not have been above cutting his throat.",joseph
"An old fighting sea-dog, a
Brother of the Coast, had more right to such plunder than anybody on
earth.",joseph
"So at odd times, while at sea, he had busied himself within the
privacy of his cabin in constructing the ingenious canvas waistcoat in
which he could take his treasure ashore secretly.",joseph
"It was bulky, but his
garments were of an ample cut, and no wretched customs-guard would dare
to lay hands on a successful prize-master going to the Port Admiral’s
offices to make his report.",joseph
The scheme had worked perfectly.,joseph
"He found,
however, that this secret garment, which was worth precisely its weight
in gold, tried his endurance more than he had expected.",joseph
"It wearied his
body and even depressed his spirits somewhat.",joseph
"It made him less active
and also less communicative.",joseph
"It reminded him all the time that he must
not get into trouble of any sort--keep clear of rows, of intimacies, of
promiscuous jollities.",joseph
"This was one of the reasons why he had been
anxious to get away from the town.",joseph
"Once, however, his head was laid on
his treasure he could sleep the sleep of the just.",joseph
Nevertheless in the morning he shrank from putting it on again.,joseph
"With a
mixture of sailor’s carelessness and of old-standing belief in his own
luck he simply stuffed the precious waistcoat up the flue of the empty
fireplace.",joseph
Then he dressed and had his breakfast.,joseph
"An hour later,
mounted on a hired mule, he started down the track as calmly as though
setting out to explore the mysteries of a desert island.",joseph
"His aim was the end of the peninsula which, advancing like a colossal
jetty into the sea, divides the picturesque roadstead of Hyères from the
headlands and curves of the coast forming the approaches of the Port of
Toulon.",joseph
"The path along which the sure-footed mule took him (for Peyrol,
once he had put its head the right way, made no attempt at steering)
descended rapidly to a plain of arid aspect, with the white gleams of
the Salins in the distance, bounded by bluish hills of no great
elevation.",joseph
"Soon all traces of human habitations disappeared from before
his roaming eyes.",joseph
"This part of his native country was more foreign to
him than the shores of the Mozambique Channel, the coral strands of
India, the forests of Madagascar.",joseph
"Before long he found himself on the
neck of the Giens peninsula, impregnated with salt and containing a blue
lagoon, particularly blue, darker and even more still than the expanses
of the sea to the right and left of it, from which it was separated by
narrow strips of land not a hundred yards wide in places.",joseph
"The track ran
indistinct, presenting no wheel-ruts, and with patches of efflorescent
salt as white as snow between the tufts of wiry grass and the
particularly dead-looking bushes.",joseph
"The whole neck of land was so low that
it seemed to have no more thickness than a sheet of paper laid on the
sea.",joseph
"Citizen Peyrol saw on the level of his eye, as if from a mere raft,
sails of various craft, some white and some brown, while before him his
native island of Porquerolles rose dull and solid beyond a wide strip of
water.",joseph
"The mule, which knew rather better than Citizen Peyrol where it
was going to, took him presently amongst the gentle rises at the end of
the peninsula.",joseph
"The slopes were covered with scanty grass; crooked
boundary walls of dry stones ran across the fields, and above them, here
and there, peeped a low roof of red tiles shaded by the heads of
delicate acacias.",joseph
"At a turn of the ravine appeared a village with its
few houses, mostly with their blind walls to the path, and, at first, no
living soul in sight.",joseph
"Three tall platanes, very ragged as to their bark
and very poor as to foliage, stood in a group in an open space; and
Citizen Peyrol was cheered up by the sight of a dog sleeping in the
shade.",joseph
"The mule swerved with great determination towards a massive stone
trough under the village fountain.",joseph
"Peyrol, looking round from the saddle
while the mule drank, could see no signs of an inn.",joseph
"Then, examining the
ground nearer to him, he perceived a ragged man sitting on a stone.",joseph
"He
had a broad leathern belt and his legs were bare to the knee.",joseph
"He was
contemplating the stranger on the mule with stony surprise.",joseph
"His dark
nut-brown face contrasted strongly with his grey shock of hair.",joseph
"At a
sign from Peyrol he showed no reluctance and approached him readily
without changing the stony character of his stare.",joseph
"The thought that if he had remained at home he would have probably
looked like that man crossed unbidden the mind of Peyrol.",joseph
"With that
gravity from which he seldom departed he inquired if there were any
inhabitants besides himself in the village.",joseph
"Then, to Peyrol’s surprise,
that destitute idler smiled pleasantly and said that the people were out
looking after their bits of land.",joseph
"There was enough of the peasant-born in Peyrol, still, to remark that he
had seen no man, woman, or child, or four-footed beast for hours, and
that he would hardly have thought that there was any land worth looking
after anywhere around.",joseph
But the other insisted.,joseph
"Well, they were working
on it all the same, at least those that had any.",joseph
"At the sound of the voices the dog got up with a strange air of being
all backbone, and, approaching in dismal fidelity, stood with his nose
close to his master’s calves.",joseph
"“And you,” said Peyrol, “you have no land then?” The man took his time
to answer.",joseph
"“I have a boat.”

Peyrol became interested when the man explained that his boat was on the
salt pond, the large, deserted and opaque sheet of water lying dead
between the two great bays of the living sea.",joseph
"Peyrol wondered aloud why
anyone should want a boat on it.",joseph
"“There is fish there,” said the man.",joseph
“And is the boat all your worldly goods?” asked Peyrol.,joseph
"The flies buzzed, the mule hung its head, moving its ears and flapping
its thin tail languidly.",joseph
"“I have a sort of hut down by the lagoon and a net or two,” the man
confessed, as it were.",joseph
"Peyrol, looking down, completed the list by
saying: “And this dog.”

The man again took his time to say:

“He is company.”

Peyrol sat as serious as a judge.",joseph
"“You haven’t much to make a living
of,” he delivered himself at last.",joseph
“However!...,joseph
"Is there no inn, café,
or some place where one could put up for a day?",joseph
"I have heard up inland
that there was some such place.”

“I will show it to you,” said the man, who then went back to where he
had been sitting and picked up a large empty basket before he led the
way.",joseph
"His dog followed with his head and tail low, and then came Peyrol
dangling his heels against the sides of the intelligent mule, which
seemed to know beforehand all that was going to happen.",joseph
"At the corner
where the houses ended there stood an old wooden cross stuck into a
square block of stone.",joseph
"The lonely boatman of the Lagoon of Pesquiers
pointed in the direction of a branching path where the rises terminating
the peninsula sank into a shallow pass.",joseph
"There were leaning pines on the
skyline, and in the pass itself dull silvery green patches of olive
orchards below a long yellow wall backed by dark cypresses, and the red
roofs of buildings which seemed to belong to a farm.",joseph
“Will they lodge me there?” asked Peyrol.,joseph
﻿CHAPTER I.,mark
"You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter.",mark
"That book was made
by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.",mark
"There was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.",mark
That is nothing.,mark
"I
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt
Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.",mark
"Aunt Polly—Tom’s Aunt Polly, she
is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book,
which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.",mark
"Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.",mark
"We got six
thousand dollars apiece—all gold.",mark
"It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up.",mark
"Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at
interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round—more than a body could tell what to do with.",mark
"The Widow Douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t stand
it no longer I lit out.",mark
"I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.",mark
"But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and
said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I
would go back to the widow and be respectable.",mark
So I went back.,mark
"The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.",mark
"She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.",mark
"Well, then, the old thing
commenced again.",mark
"The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come
to time.",mark
"When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to eating, but
you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a
little over the victuals, though there warn’t really anything the
matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by
itself.",mark
"In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed
up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.",mark
"After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but
by-and-by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long
time; so then I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no
stock in dead people.",mark
"Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.",mark
"But she
wouldn’t.",mark
"She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t clean, and I must
try to not do it any more.",mark
That is just the way with some people.,mark
"They
get down on a thing when they don’t know nothing about it.",mark
"Here she was
a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to
anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for
doing a thing that had some good in it.",mark
"And she took snuff, too; of
course that was all right, because she done it herself.",mark
"Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,
had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a
spelling-book.",mark
"She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then
the widow made her ease up.",mark
I couldn’t stood it much longer.,mark
"Then for
an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.",mark
"Miss Watson would say,
“Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t scrunch up like
that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty soon she would say,
“Don’t gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don’t you try to
behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished
I was there.",mark
"She got mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm.",mark
"All I wanted
was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular.",mark
"She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for
the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.",mark
"Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was going, so I
made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it.",mark
"But I never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no good.",mark
"Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
place.",mark
"She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.",mark
"So I didn’t think much
of it.",mark
But I never said so.,mark
"I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer
would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.",mark
"I was glad
about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.",mark
"Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.",mark
"By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed.",mark
"I went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table.",mark
"Then I set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no use.",mark
"I felt so
lonesome I most wished I was dead.",mark
"The stars were shining, and the
leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away
off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a
dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was
trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was,
and so it made the cold shivers run over me.",mark
"Then away out in the woods
I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell
about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood,
and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every
night grieving.",mark
"I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some
company.",mark
"Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I
flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it
was all shriveled up.",mark
"I didn’t need anybody to tell me that that was an
awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and
most shook the clothes off of me.",mark
"I got up and turned around in my
tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up
a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.",mark
"But I
hadn’t no confidence.",mark
"You do that when you’ve lost a horseshoe that
you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn’t ever
heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you’d killed
a spider.",mark
"I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;
for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t
know.",mark
"Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever.",mark
"Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees—something was a stirring.",mark
I set still and listened.,mark
"Directly I
could just barely hear a “_me-yow!",mark
me-yow!_” down there.,mark
That was good!,mark
"Says I, “_me-yow!",mark
"me-yow!_” as soft as I could, and then I put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.",mark
"Then I slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.",mark
CHAPTER II.,mark
"We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end
of the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrape
our heads.",mark
"When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and
made a noise.",mark
We scrouched down and laid still.,mark
"Miss Watson’s big
nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him
pretty clear, because there was a light behind him.",mark
"He got up and
stretched his neck out about a minute, listening.",mark
"Then he says:

“Who dah?”

He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us; we could a touched him, nearly.",mark
"Well, likely it was minutes
and minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close
together.",mark
"There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I
dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,
right between my shoulders.",mark
Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.,mark
"Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.",mark
"If you are with the
quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’t
sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, why
you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.",mark
"Pretty soon Jim
says:

“Say, who is you?",mark
Whar is you?,mark
Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.,mark
"Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here and
listen tell I hears it agin.”

So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.",mark
"He leaned his back up
against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most
touched one of mine.",mark
My nose begun to itch.,mark
"It itched till the tears
come into my eyes.",mark
But I dasn’t scratch.,mark
"Then it begun to itch on the
inside.",mark
Next I got to itching underneath.,mark
"I didn’t know how I was going
to set still.",mark
"This miserableness went on as much as six or seven
minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.",mark
"I was itching in
eleven different places now.",mark
"I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n a
minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.",mark
"Just then
Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I was
pretty soon comfortable again.",mark
"Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we
went creeping away on our hands and knees.",mark
"When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.",mark
"But I said
no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out I
warn’t in.",mark
"Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he would
slip in the kitchen and get some more.",mark
I didn’t want him to try.,mark
"I said
Jim might wake up and come.",mark
"But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in
there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for
pay.",mark
"Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing
would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and
knees, and play something on him.",mark
"I waited, and it seemed a good while,
everything was so still and lonesome.",mark
"As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,
and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house.",mark
"Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it on
a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.",mark
"Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance,
and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees
again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.",mark
"And next time
Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,
every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he
said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and
his back was all over saddle-boils.",mark
"Jim was monstrous proud about it,
and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers.",mark
"Niggers
would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up
to than any nigger in that country.",mark
"Strange niggers would stand with
their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.",mark
"Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen
fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about
such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!",mark
"What you know ’bout
witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.",mark
"Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,
and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and
told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he
wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was
he said to it.",mark
"Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim
anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they
wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it.",mark
"Jim was
most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having
seen the devil and been rode by witches.",mark
"Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away
down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,
where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling
ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile
broad, and awful still and grand.",mark
"We went down the hill and found Jo
Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the
old tanyard.",mark
"So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile
and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.",mark
"We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
part of the bushes.",mark
"Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
hands and knees.",mark
"We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
opened up.",mark
"Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.",mark
"We
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.",mark
"Tom says:

“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.",mark
"Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his
name in blood.”

Everybody was willing.",mark
"So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it.",mark
"It swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything
to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person
and his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep till
he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the
sign of the band.",mark
"And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could use
that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he
must be killed.",mark
"And if anybody that belonged to the band told the
secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt
up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the
list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse
put on it and be forgot forever.",mark
"Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it
out of his own head.",mark
"He said, some of it, but the rest was out of
pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
it.",mark
"Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
the secrets.",mark
"Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
it in.",mark
"Then Ben Rogers says:

“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bout
him?”

“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.",mark
"“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days.",mark
"He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seen
in these parts for a year or more.”

They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldn’t be fair and square for the others.",mark
"Well, nobody could think of
anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still.",mark
"I was most ready
to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss
Watson—they could kill her.",mark
"Everybody said:

“Oh, she’ll do.",mark
That’s all right.,mark
"Huck can come in.”

Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and I made my mark on the paper.",mark
"“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”

“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.",mark
"“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”

“Stuff!",mark
"stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”
says Tom Sawyer.",mark
“We ain’t burglars.,mark
That ain’t no sort of style.,mark
"We
are highwaymen.",mark
"We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”

“Must we always kill the people?”

“Oh, certainly.",mark
It’s best.,mark
"Some authorities think different, but mostly
it’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the
cave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”

“Ransomed?",mark
"What’s that?”

“I don’t know.",mark
But that’s what they do.,mark
"I’ve seen it in books; and so
of course that’s what we’ve got to do.”

“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”

“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it.",mark
"Don’t I tell you it’s in the
books?",mark
"Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,
and get things all muddled up?”

“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation
are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it to
them?—that’s the thing _I_ want to get at.",mark
"Now, what do you _reckon_ it
is?”

“Well, I don’t know.",mark
"But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,
it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”

“Now, that’s something _like_.",mark
That’ll answer.,mark
"Why couldn’t you said
that before?",mark
"We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a
bothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying
to get loose.”

“How you talk, Ben Rogers.",mark
"How can they get loose when there’s a guard
over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”

“A guard!",mark
"Well, that _is_ good.",mark
"So somebody’s got to set up all night
and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.",mark
"I think that’s
foolishness.",mark
"Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon as
they get here?”

“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why.",mark
"Now, Ben Rogers, do you
want to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea.",mark
"Don’t you
reckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correct
thing to do?",mark
Do you reckon _you_ can learn ’em anything?,mark
"Not by a good
deal.",mark
"No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”

“All right.",mark
"I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow.",mark
"Say, do we
kill the women, too?”

“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on.",mark
"Kill
the women?",mark
No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.,mark
"You
fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; and
by-and-by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any
more.”

“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.",mark
"Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows
waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.",mark
"But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”

Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was
scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t
want to be a robber any more.",mark
"So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him
mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.",mark
"But Tom
give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.",mark
"Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he
wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked
to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing.",mark
"They agreed to get
together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom
Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so
started home.",mark
"I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking.",mark
"My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was
dog-tired.",mark
CHAPTER III.,mark
"Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave a while if I could.",mark
"Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet
and prayed, but nothing come of it.",mark
"She told me to pray every day, and
whatever I asked for I would get it.",mark
But it warn’t so.,mark
I tried it.,mark
"Once
I got a fish-line, but no hooks.",mark
"It warn’t any good to me without
hooks.",mark
"I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I
couldn’t make it work.",mark
"By-and-by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try
for me, but she said I was a fool.",mark
"She never told me why, and I
couldn’t make it out no way.",mark
"I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.",mark
"I
says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?",mark
"Why can’t the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole?",mark
Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?,mark
"No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it.",mark

I might 'a' thought of that closet.,mark
"What you been doing in
there?""",mark
"""Nothing.""",mark
"""Nothing!",mark
Look at your hands.,mark
And look at your mouth.,mark
"What IS that
truck?""",mark
"""I don't know, aunt.""",mark
"""Well, I know.",mark
It's jam--that's what it is.,mark
"Forty times I've said if
you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you.",mark
"Hand me that switch.""",mark
"The switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--

""My!",mark

"The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.",mark
"The
lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.",mark
"His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.",mark
"""Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything?",mark
"Ain't he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?",mark
"But old
fools is the biggest fools there is.",mark
"Can't learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is.",mark
"But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know what's coming?",mark
"He 'pears to know just how
long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he
can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down
again and I can't hit him a lick.",mark
"I ain't doing my duty by that boy,
and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows.",mark

the child, as the Good Book says.",mark

us both, I know.",mark
"He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me!",mark

own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash
him, somehow.",mark
"Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,
and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.",mark
"Well-a-well, man
that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the
Scripture says, and I reckon it's so.",mark
"He'll play hookey this evening, *
and [* Southwestern for ""afternoon""] I'll just be obleeged to make him
work, to-morrow, to punish him.",mark
"It's mighty hard to make him work
Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more
than he hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my duty by him,
or I'll be the ruination of the child.""",mark
"Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time.",mark
"He got back home
barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's
wood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in
time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the
work.",mark
"Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already
through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a
quiet boy, and had no adventurous, troublesome ways.",mark
"While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments.",mark
"Like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning.",mark
"Said she:

""Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?""",mark
"""Yes'm.""",mark
"""Powerful warm, warn't it?""",mark
"""Yes'm.""",mark
"""Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?""",mark
A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.,mark
"He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing.",mark
"So he said:

""No'm--well, not very much.""",mark
"The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:

""But you ain't too warm now, though.""",mark
"And it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind.",mark
"But in spite of her, Tom knew
where the wind lay, now.",mark
"So he forestalled what might be the next move:

""Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet.",mark
"See?""",mark
"Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick.",mark
"Then she had a new
inspiration:

""Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
pump on your head, did you?",mark
"Unbutton your jacket!""",mark
The trouble vanished out of Tom's face.,mark
He opened his jacket.,mark
"His
shirt collar was securely sewed.",mark
"""Bother!",mark
"Well, go 'long with you.",mark
"I'd made sure you'd played hookey
and been a-swimming.",mark
"But I forgive ye, Tom.",mark
"I reckon you're a kind of a
singed cat, as the saying is--better'n you look.",mark
"THIS time.""",mark
"She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.",mark
"But Sidney said:

""Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,
but it's black.""",mark
"""Why, I did sew it with white!",mark
"Tom!""",mark
But Tom did not wait for the rest.,mark
"As he went out at the door he said:

""Siddy, I'll lick you for that.""",mark
"In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle
carried white thread and the other black.",mark
"He said:

""She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid.",mark
Confound it!,mark
"sometimes
she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black.",mark
"I wish to
geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em.",mark
"But
I bet you I'll lam Sid for that.",mark
"I'll learn him!""",mark
He was not the Model Boy of the village.,mark
"He knew the model boy very
well though--and loathed him.",mark
"Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles.",mark
"Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him
than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.",mark
"This
new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just
acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed.",mark
"It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how
to do it, if he has ever been a boy.",mark
"Diligence and attention soon gave
him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full
of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.",mark
"He felt much as an
astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as
strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with
the boy, not the astronomer.",mark
The summer evenings were long.,mark
"It was not dark, yet.",mark
"Presently Tom
checked his whistle.",mark
"A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger
than himself.",mark
"A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg.",mark
"This boy
was well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day.",mark
"This was simply
astounding.",mark
"His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons.",mark
"He had shoes
on--and it was only Friday.",mark
"He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
ribbon.",mark
He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals.,mark
"The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his
nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed
to him to grow.",mark
Neither boy spoke.,mark
"If one moved, the other moved--but
only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all
the time.",mark
"Finally Tom said:

""I can lick you!""",mark
"""I'd like to see you try it.""",mark
"""Well, I can do it.""",mark
"""No you can't, either.""",mark
"""Yes I can.""",mark
"""No you can't.""",mark
"""I can.""",mark
"""You can't.""",mark
"""Can!""",mark
"""Can't!""",mark
An uncomfortable pause.,mark
"Then Tom said:

""What's your name?""",mark
"""'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.""",mark
"""Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business.""",mark
"""Well why don't you?""",mark
"""If you say much, I will.""",mark
"""Much--much--MUCH.",mark
"There now.""",mark
"""Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you?",mark
"I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.""",mark
"""Well why don't you DO it?",mark
"You SAY you can do it.""",mark
"""Well I WILL, if you fool with me.""",mark
"""Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.""",mark
"""Smarty!",mark
"You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you?",mark
"Oh, what a hat!""",mark
"""You can lump that hat if you don't like it.",mark
"I dare you to knock it
off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.""",mark
"""You're a liar!""",mark
"""You're another.""",mark
"""You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.""",mark
"""Aw--take a walk!""",mark
"""Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a
rock off'n your head.""",mark
"""Oh, of COURSE you will.""",mark
"""Well I WILL.""",mark
"""Well why don't you DO it then?",mark
What do you keep SAYING you will for?,mark
Why don't you DO it?,mark
"It's because you're afraid.""",mark
"""I AIN'T afraid.""",mark
"""You are.""",mark
"""I ain't.""",mark
"""You are.""",mark
"Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other.",mark
"Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder.",mark
"Tom said:

""Get away from here!""",mark
"""Go away yourself!""",mark
"""I won't.""",mark
"""I won't either.""",mark
"So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and
both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with
hate.",mark
But neither could get an advantage.,mark
"After struggling till both
were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution,
and Tom said:

""You're a coward and a pup.",mark
"I'll tell my big brother on you, and he
can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.""",mark
"""What do I care for your big brother?",mark
"I've got a brother that's bigger
than he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.""",mark
[Both brothers were imaginary.],mark
"""That's a lie.""",mark
"""YOUR saying so don't make it so.""",mark
"Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:

""I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand
up.",mark
"Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.""",mark
"The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:

""Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.""",mark
"""Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.""",mark
"""Well, you SAID you'd do it--why don't you do it?""",mark
"""By jingo!",mark
"for two cents I WILL do it.""",mark
"The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision.",mark
Tom struck them to the ground.,mark
"In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and
clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered
themselves with dust and glory.",mark
"Presently the confusion took form, and
through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and
pounding him with his fists.",mark
"""Holler 'nuff!""",mark
said he.,mark
The boy only struggled to free himself.,mark
He was crying--mainly from rage.,mark
"""Holler 'nuff!""",mark
--and the pounding went on.,mark
"At last the stranger got out a smothered ""'Nuff!""",mark
"and Tom let him up
and said:

""Now that'll learn you.",mark
"Better look out who you're fooling with next
time.""",mark
"The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the ""next time he caught him out.""",mark
"To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw
it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope.",mark
"Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
lived.",mark
"He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined.",mark
"At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called
Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away.",mark
"So he went
away; but he said he ""'lowed"" to ""lay"" for that boy.",mark
"He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;
and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn
his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in
its firmness.",mark
"﻿CHAPTER IV

THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction.",mark
"Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter
of the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.",mark
"Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to ""get
his verses.""",mark
Sid had learned his lesson days before.,mark
"Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.",mark
"At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations.",mark
"Mary
took his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through
the fog:

""Blessed are the--a--a--""

""Poor""--

""Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--""

""In spirit--""

""In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--""

""THEIRS--""

""For THEIRS.",mark
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.",mark
"Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--""

""Sh--""

""For they--a--""

""S, H, A--""

""For they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!""",mark
"""SHALL!""",mark
"""Oh, SHALL!",mark
"for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--
blessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for
they shall--a--shall WHAT?",mark
"Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you
want to be so mean for?""",mark
"""Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you.",mark
"I wouldn't
do that.",mark
You must go and learn it again.,mark
"Don't you be discouraged, Tom,
you'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.",mark
"There, now, that's a good boy.""",mark
"""All right!",mark
"What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.""",mark
"""Never you mind, Tom.",mark
"You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.""",mark
"""You bet you that's so, Mary.",mark
"All right, I'll tackle it again.""",mark
"And he did ""tackle it again""--and under the double pressure of
curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
accomplished a shining success.",mark
"Mary gave him a brand-new ""Barlow""
knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that
swept his system shook him to his foundations.",mark
"True, the knife would
not cut anything, but it was a ""sure-enough"" Barlow, and there was
inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got
the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its
injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.",mark
"Tom
contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin
on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.",mark
"Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the
kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the
door.",mark
"But Mary removed the towel and said:

""Now ain't you ashamed, Tom.",mark
You mustn't be so bad.,mark
"Water won't hurt
you.""",mark
Tom was a trifle disconcerted.,mark
"The basin was refilled, and this time
he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big
breath and began.",mark
"When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes
shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony
of suds and water was dripping from his face.",mark
"But when he emerged from
the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck.",mark
"Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.",mark
"[He privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and
his own filled his life with bitterness.]",mark
"Then Mary got out a suit of
his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they
were simply called his ""other clothes""--and so by that we know the
size of his wardrobe.",mark
"The girl ""put him to rights"" after he had dressed
himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his
vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned
him with his speckled straw hat.",mark
"He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable.",mark
"He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him.",mark
"He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them
out.",mark
"He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn't want to do.",mark
"But Mary said, persuasively:

""Please, Tom--that's a good boy.""",mark
So he got into the shoes snarling.,mark
"Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his
whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.",mark
"Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service.",mark
"Two of the children always remained for the sermon
voluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.",mark
"The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three
hundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort
of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.",mark
"At the door Tom
dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:

""Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?""",mark
"""Yes.""",mark
"""What'll you take for her?""",mark
"""What'll you give?""",mark
"""Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.""",mark
"""Less see 'em.""",mark
Tom exhibited.,mark
"They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.",mark
"Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and
some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.",mark
"He waylaid other
boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or
fifteen minutes longer.",mark
"He entered the church, now, with a swarm of
clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a
quarrel with the first boy that came handy.",mark
"The teacher, a grave,
elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
him say ""Ouch!""",mark
and got a new reprimand from his teacher.,mark
"Tom's whole
class were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome.",mark
"When they
came to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses
perfectly, but had to be prompted all along.",mark
"However, they worried
through, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a
passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of
the recitation.",mark
"Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be
exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow
tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty
cents in those easy times) to the pupil.",mark
"How many of my readers would
have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even
for a Dore Bible?",mark
"And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it
was the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had
won four or five.",mark
"He once recited three thousand verses without
stopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and
he was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous
misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the
superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out
and ""spread himself.""",mark
"Only the older pupils managed to keep their
tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and
so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
circumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for
that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh
ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks.",mark
"It is possible that Tom's
mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but
unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory
and the eclat that came with it.",mark
"In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves, and commanded attention.",mark
"When a Sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert
--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of
music is ever referred to by the sufferer.",mark
"This superintendent was a
slim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair;
he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his
ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
mouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning
of the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped
on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note,
and had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the
fashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and
laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes
pressed against a wall for hours together.",mark
"Mr. Walters was very earnest
of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred
things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly
matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had
acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days.",mark
"He
began after this fashion:

""Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty
as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two.",mark
"There
--that is it.",mark
That is the way good little boys and girls should do.,mark
"I see
one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she
thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making
a speech to the little birds.",mark
[Applausive titter.],mark
"I want to tell you
how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces
assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.""",mark
"And
so forth and so on.",mark
"It is not necessary to set down the rest of the
oration.",mark
"It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar
to us all.",mark
"The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases
of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.",mark
"But now every
sound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and
the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent
gratitude.",mark
"A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which
was more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher,
accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged
gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless
the latter's wife.",mark
The lady was leading a child.,mark
"Tom had been restless
and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could
not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze.",mark
"But
when he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in
a moment.",mark
"The next moment he was ""showing off"" with all his might
--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art
that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause.",mark
"His
exaltation had but one alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this
angel's garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under
the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.",mark
"The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school.",mark
"The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one
than the county judge--altogether the most august creation these
children had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material
he was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half
afraid he might, too.",mark
"He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so
he had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon
the county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof.",mark
"The awe
which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence
and the ranks of staring eyes.",mark
"This was the great Judge Thatcher,
brother of their own lawyer.",mark
"Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to
be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school.",mark
"It would
have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:

""Look at him, Jim!",mark
He's a going up there.,mark
Say--look!,mark
"he's a going to
shake hands with him--he IS shaking hands with him!",mark
"By jings, don't you
wish you was Jeff?""",mark
"Mr. Walters fell to ""showing off,"" with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a
target.",mark
"The librarian ""showed off""--running hither and thither with his
arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
insect authority delights in.",mark
"The young lady teachers ""showed off""
--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting
pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones
lovingly.",mark
"The young gentlemen teachers ""showed off"" with small
scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to
discipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up
at the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had
to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation).",mark
"The little girls ""showed off"" in various ways, and the little boys
""showed off"" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
and the murmur of scufflings.",mark
"And above it all the great man sat and
beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself
in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was ""showing off,"" too.",mark
"There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy
complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a
prodigy.",mark
"Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough
--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring.",mark
"He would have given
worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.",mark
"And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward
with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and
demanded a Bible.",mark
This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.,mark
"Walters
was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten
years.",mark
"But there was no getting around it--here were the certified
checks, and they were good for their face.",mark
"Tom was therefore elevated
to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was
announced from headquarters.",mark
"It was the most stunning surprise of the
decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero
up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to
gaze upon in place of one.",mark
"The boys were all eaten up with envy--but
those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too
late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by
trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling
whitewashing privileges.",mark
"These despised themselves, as being the dupes
of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.",mark
"The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt.",mark
"Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
her face--but he wouldn't look.",mark
"She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;
a furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody.",mark
"Tom
most of all (she thought).",mark
"Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful
greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent.",mark
"He would
have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark.",mark
"The
Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was.",mark
"The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:

""Tom.""",mark
"""Oh, no, not Tom--it is--""

""Thomas.""",mark
"""Ah, that's it.",mark
"I thought there was more to it, maybe.",mark
"That's very
well.",mark
"But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't
you?""",mark
"""Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,"" said Walters, ""and say
sir.",mark
"You mustn't forget your manners.""",mark
"""Thomas Sawyer--sir.""",mark
"""That's it!",mark
That's a good boy.,mark
Fine boy.,mark
"Fine, manly little fellow.",mark
"Two thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many.",mark
"And you
never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for
knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it's what
makes great men and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man
yourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all
owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all
owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to
the good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and
gave me a beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have
it all for my own, always--it's all owing to right bringing up!",mark
"That is
what you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those
two thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn't.",mark
"And now you wouldn't mind
telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know
you wouldn't--for we are proud of little boys that learn.",mark
"Now, no
doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples.",mark
"Won't you tell us
the names of the first two that were appointed?""",mark
Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish.,mark
"He blushed,
now, and his eyes fell.",mark
Mr. Walters' heart sank within him.,mark
"He said to
himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question--why DID the Judge ask him?",mark
"Yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say:

""Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.""",mark
Tom still hung fire.,mark
"""Now I know you'll tell me,"" said the lady.",mark
"""The names of the first
two disciples were--""

""DAVID AND GOLIAH!""",mark
Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.,mark
"CHAPTER V

ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.",mark
"The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision.",mark
"Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed
next the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open
window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible.",mark
"The crowd
filed up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better
days; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her
hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and
much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg
could boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer
Riverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the
village, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young
heart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they
had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of
oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet;
and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful
care of his mother as if she were cut glass.",mark
"He always brought his
mother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons.",mark
"The boys all
hated him, he was so good.",mark
"And besides, he had been ""thrown up to them""
so much.",mark
"His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as
usual on Sundays--accidentally.",mark
"Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked
upon boys who had as snobs.",mark
"The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery.",mark
"The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service.",mark
"There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now.",mark
"It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country.",mark
"The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in
a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.",mark
"His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached
a certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost
word and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:

  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of ease,

  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOODY seas?",mark
He was regarded as a wonderful reader.,mark
"At church ""sociables"" he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and ""wall"" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, ""Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.""",mark
"After the hymn had been sung, the Rev.",mark
"Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a bulletin-board, and read off ""notices"" of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
doom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
away here in this age of abundant newspapers.",mark
"Often, the less there is
to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.",mark
And now the minister prayed.,mark
"A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good.",mark
Amen.,mark
"There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat
down.",mark
"The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,
he only endured it--if he even did that much.",mark
"He was restive all
through it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously
--for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the
clergyman's regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new
matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature
resented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly.",mark
"In the
midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of
him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together,
embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that
it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread
of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs
and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going
through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly
safe.",mark
"As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for
it they did not dare--he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed
if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.",mark
"But with the
closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the
instant the ""Amen"" was out the fly was a prisoner of war.",mark
"His aunt
detected the act and made him let it go.",mark
"The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through
an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod
--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
hardly worth the saving.",mark
"Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after
church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew
anything else about the discourse.",mark
"However, this time he was really
interested for a little while.",mark
"The minister made a grand and moving
picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the
millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
little child should lead them.",mark
"But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he
wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.",mark
"Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.",mark
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out.,mark
"It was
a large black beetle with formidable jaws--a ""pinchbug,"" he called it.",mark
It was in a percussion-cap box.,mark
"The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger.",mark
"A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger
went into the boy's mouth.",mark
"The beetle lay there working its helpless
legs, unable to turn over.",mark
"Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was
safe out of his reach.",mark
"Other people uninterested in the sermon found
relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too.",mark
"﻿CHAPTER VIII

TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of
the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog.",mark
"He
crossed a small ""branch"" two or three times, because of a prevailing
juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit.",mark
"Half an hour
later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of
Cardiff Hill, and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off
in the valley behind him.",mark
"He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless
way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading
oak.",mark
"There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had
even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was
broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a
woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense
of loneliness the more profound.",mark
"The boy's soul was steeped in
melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings.",mark
"He
sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,
meditating.",mark
"It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and
he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be
very peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and
ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the
grass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve
about, ever any more.",mark
"If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he
could be willing to go, and be done with it all.",mark
Now as to this girl.,mark
What had he done?,mark
Nothing.,mark
"He had meant the best in the world, and been
treated like a dog--like a very dog.",mark
"She would be sorry some day--maybe
when it was too late.",mark
"Ah, if he could only die TEMPORARILY!",mark
"But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one
constrained shape long at a time.",mark
"Tom presently began to drift
insensibly back into the concerns of this life again.",mark
"What if he turned
his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously?",mark
"What if he went away--ever
so far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came
back any more!",mark
How would she feel then!,mark
"The idea of being a clown
recurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust.",mark
"For frivolity and
jokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves
upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the
romantic.",mark
"No, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all
war-worn and illustrious.",mark
"No--better still, he would join the Indians,
and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the
trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come
back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and
prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a
bloodcurdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions
with unappeasable envy.",mark
"But no, there was something gaudier even than
this.",mark
He would be a pirate!,mark
That was it!,mark
"NOW his future lay plain
before him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor.",mark
"How his name would
fill the world, and make people shudder!",mark
"How gloriously he would go
plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the
Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore!",mark
"And at
the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village
and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet
doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt
bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his
slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull
and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings,
""It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!""",mark
"Yes, it was settled; his career was determined.",mark
"He would run away from
home and enter upon it.",mark
He would start the very next morning.,mark
"Therefore
he must now begin to get ready.",mark
"He would collect his resources
together.",mark
"He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under
one end of it with his Barlow knife.",mark
"He soon struck wood that sounded
hollow.",mark
"He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:

""What hasn't come here, come!",mark
"What's here, stay here!""",mark
"Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle.",mark
"He took it
up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
were of shingles.",mark
In it lay a marble.,mark
Tom's astonishment was boundless!,mark
"He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:

""Well, that beats anything!""",mark
"Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating.",mark
"The
truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible.",mark
"If you buried a
marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had
gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they
had been separated.",mark
"But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably
failed.",mark
Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.,mark
"He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its
failing before.",mark
"It did not occur to him that he had tried it several
times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places
afterward.",mark
"He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided
that some witch had interfered and broken the charm.",mark
"He thought he
would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he
found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it.",mark
"He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and
called--

""Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!",mark
"Doodle-bug,
doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!""",mark
"The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
second and then darted under again in a fright.",mark
"""He dasn't tell!",mark
So it WAS a witch that done it.,mark
"I just knowed it.""",mark
"He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
gave up discouraged.",mark
"But it occurred to him that he might as well have
the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
patient search for it.",mark
But he could not find it.,mark
"Now he went back to
his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been
standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble
from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:

""Brother, go find your brother!""",mark
"He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked.",mark
"But it must
have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more.",mark
"The last
repetition was successful.",mark
"The two marbles lay within a foot of each
other.",mark
"Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
aisles of the forest.",mark
"Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a
suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in
a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with
fluttering shirt.",mark
"He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
and that.",mark
"He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:

""Hold, my merry men!",mark
"Keep hid till I blow.""",mark
"Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.",mark
"Tom called:

""Hold!",mark
"Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?""",mark
"""Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass.",mark
"Who art thou that--that--""

""Dares to hold such language,"" said Tom, prompting--for they talked
""by the book,"" from memory.",mark
"""Who art thou that dares to hold such language?""",mark
"""I, indeed!",mark
"I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.""",mark
"""Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw?",mark
"Right gladly will I dispute
with thee the passes of the merry wood.",mark
"Have at thee!""",mark
"They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
combat, ""two up and two down.""",mark
"Presently Tom said:

""Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!""",mark
"So they ""went it lively,"" panting and perspiring with the work.",mark
"By and
by Tom shouted:

""Fall!",mark
fall!,mark
"Why don't you fall?""",mark
"""I sha'n't!",mark
Why don't you fall yourself?,mark
"You're getting the worst of
it.""",mark
"""Why, that ain't anything.",mark
"I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in
the book.",mark
"The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor
Guy of Guisborne.'",mark
"You're to turn around and let me hit you in the
back.""",mark
"There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received
the whack and fell.",mark
"""Now,"" said Joe, getting up, ""you got to let me kill YOU.",mark
"That's fair.""",mark
"""Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.""",mark
"""Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.""",mark
"""Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and
lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and
you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.""",mark
"This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out.",mark
"Then
Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
bleed his strength away through his neglected wound.",mark
"And at last Joe,
representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, ""Where this arrow
falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.""",mark
"Then he
shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a
nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.",mark
"The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.",mark
"They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
President of the United States forever.",mark
"CHAPTER IX

AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.",mark
"They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep.",mark
"Tom lay awake and
waited, in restless impatience.",mark
"When it seemed to him that it must be
nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten!",mark
This was despair.,mark
"He
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake Sid.",mark
"So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.",mark
Everything was dismally still.,mark
"By and by, out of the stillness, little,
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves.",mark
"The ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice.",mark
"Old beams began to
crack mysteriously.",mark
The stairs creaked faintly.,mark
"Evidently spirits were
abroad.",mark
"A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber.",mark
"And
now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could
locate, began.",mark
"Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at
the bed's head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody's days were
numbered.",mark
"Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was
answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.",mark
"Tom was in an
agony.",mark
"At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity
begun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven,
but he did not hear it.",mark
"And then there came, mingling with his
half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling.",mark
"The raising of a
neighboring window disturbed him.",mark
"A cry of ""Scat!",mark
"you devil!""",mark
"and the
crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed
brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and
out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ""ell"" on all
fours.",mark
"He ""meow'd"" with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped
to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.",mark
"Huckleberry Finn
was there, with his dead cat.",mark
"The boys moved off and disappeared in the
gloom.",mark
"At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall
grass of the graveyard.",mark
It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind.,mark
"It was on a
hill, about a mile and a half from the village.",mark
"It had a crazy board
fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of
the time, but stood upright nowhere.",mark
"Grass and weeds grew rank over the
whole cemetery.",mark
"All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
the graves, leaning for support and finding none.",mark
"""Sacred to the memory
of"" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer
have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.",mark
"A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed.",mark
"The boys talked
little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits.",mark
"They found the
sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet
of the grave.",mark
Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time.,mark
"The hooting
of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.",mark
Tom's reflections grew oppressive.,mark
He must force some talk.,mark
"So he said
in a whisper:

""Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?""",mark
"Huckleberry whispered:

""I wisht I knowed.",mark
"It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?""",mark
"""I bet it is.""",mark
"There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
inwardly.",mark
"Then Tom whispered:

""Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?""",mark
"""O' course he does.",mark
"Least his sperrit does.""",mark
"Tom, after a pause:

""I wish I'd said Mister Williams.",mark
But I never meant any harm.,mark
"Everybody calls him Hoss.""",mark
"""A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead
people, Tom.""",mark
"This was a damper, and conversation died again.",mark
"Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:

""Sh!""",mark
"""What is it, Tom?""",mark
And the two clung together with beating hearts.,mark
"""Sh!",mark
There 'tis again!,mark
"Didn't you hear it?""",mark
"""I--""

""There!",mark
"Now you hear it.""",mark
"""Lord, Tom, they're coming!",mark
"They're coming, sure.",mark
"What'll we do?""",mark
"""I dono.",mark
"Think they'll see us?""",mark
"""Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats.",mark
"I wisht I hadn't
come.""",mark
"""Oh, don't be afeard.",mark
I don't believe they'll bother us.,mark
"We ain't
doing any harm.",mark
"If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us
at all.""",mark
"""I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.""",mark
"""Listen!""",mark
The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed.,mark
"A muffled
sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.",mark
"""Look!",mark
"See there!""",mark
whispered Tom.,mark
"""What is it?""",mark
"""It's devil-fire.",mark
"Oh, Tom, this is awful.""",mark
"Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light.",mark
"Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:

""It's the devils sure enough.",mark
Three of 'em!,mark
"Lordy, Tom, we're goners!",mark
"Can you pray?""",mark
"""I'll try, but don't you be afeard.",mark
They ain't going to hurt us.,mark
"'Now
I lay me down to sleep, I--'""

""Sh!""",mark
"﻿CHAPTER XIII

TOM'S mind was made up now.",mark
He was gloomy and desperate.,mark
"He was a
forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found
out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had
tried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since
nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them
blame HIM for the consequences--why shouldn't they?",mark
"What right had the
friendless to complain?",mark
"Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he
would lead a life of crime.",mark
There was no choice.,mark
"By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
""take up"" tinkled faintly upon his ear.",mark
"He sobbed, now, to think he
should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very
hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
world, he must submit--but he forgave them.",mark
"Then the sobs came thick
and fast.",mark
"Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper
--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.",mark
"Plainly here were ""two souls with but a single thought.""",mark
"Tom, wiping
his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a
resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by
hoping that Joe would not forget him.",mark
"But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been
going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose.",mark
"His
mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never
tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him
and wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him
to do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having
driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.",mark
"As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to
stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death
relieved them of their troubles.",mark
Then they began to lay their plans.,mark
"Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and
dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to
Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a
life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.",mark
"Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi
River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded
island, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as
a rendezvous.",mark
"It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest.",mark
"So Jackson's
Island was chosen.",mark
"Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them.",mark
"Then they hunted up Huckleberry
Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he
was indifferent.",mark
"They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on
the river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which
was midnight.",mark
"There was a small log raft there which they meant to
capture.",mark
"Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he
could steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws.",mark
"And
before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet
glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would ""hear
something.""",mark
"All who got this vague hint were cautioned to ""be mum and
wait.""",mark
"About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place.",mark
"It was starlight, and very still.",mark
"The mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest.",mark
"Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet.",mark
"Then he gave a low, distinct whistle.",mark
"It was answered from under
the bluff.",mark
"Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way.",mark
"Then a guarded voice said:

""Who goes there?""",mark
"""Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main.",mark
"Name your names.""",mark
"""Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.""",mark
"Tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.",mark
"""'Tis well.",mark
"Give the countersign.""",mark
"Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to
the brooding night:

""BLOOD!""",mark
"Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort.",mark
"There was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it
lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.",mark
"The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
himself out with getting it there.",mark
"Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes with.",mark
"But none of the pirates smoked or
""chewed"" but himself.",mark
"The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
would never do to start without some fire.",mark
"That was a wise thought;
matches were hardly known there in that day.",mark
"They saw a fire
smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went
stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk.",mark
"They made an
imposing adventure of it, saying, ""Hist!""",mark
"every now and then, and
suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary
dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if ""the foe""
stirred, to ""let him have it to the hilt,"" because ""dead men tell no
tales.""",mark
"They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the
village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no
excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.",mark
"They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
Joe at the forward.",mark
"Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:

""Luff, and bring her to the wind!""",mark
"""Aye-aye, sir!""",mark
"""Steady, steady-y-y-y!""",mark
"""Steady it is, sir!""",mark
"""Let her go off a point!""",mark
"""Point it is, sir!""",mark
"As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
""style,"" and were not intended to mean anything in particular.",mark
"""What sail's she carrying?""",mark
"""Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.""",mark
"""Send the r'yals up!",mark
"Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye
--foretopmaststuns'l!",mark
"Lively, now!""",mark
"""Aye-aye, sir!""",mark
"""Shake out that maintogalans'l!",mark
Sheets and braces!,mark
"NOW my hearties!""",mark
"""Aye-aye, sir!""",mark
"""Hellum-a-lee--hard a port!",mark
Stand by to meet her when she comes!,mark
"Port,
port!",mark
"NOW, men!",mark
With a will!,mark
"Stead-y-y-y!""",mark
"""Steady it is, sir!""",mark
"The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her
head right, and then lay on their oars.",mark
"The river was not high, so
there was not more than a two or three mile current.",mark
"Hardly a word was
said during the next three-quarters of an hour.",mark
"Now the raft was
passing before the distant town.",mark
"Two or three glimmering lights showed
where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of
star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.",mark
"The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, ""looking his last"" upon
the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing
""she"" could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death
with dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.",mark
"It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island
beyond eyeshot of the village, and so he ""looked his last"" with a
broken and satisfied heart.",mark
"The other pirates were looking their last,
too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the
current drift them out of the range of the island.",mark
"But they discovered
the danger in time, and made shift to avert it.",mark
"About two o'clock in
the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the
head of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed
their freight.",mark
"Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old
sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to
shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open
air in good weather, as became outlaws.",mark
"They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty
steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some
bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn ""pone""
stock they had brought.",mark
"It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that
wild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited
island, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would
return to civilization.",mark
"The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw
its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple,
and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.",mark
"When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of
corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
filled with contentment.",mark
"They could have found a cooler place, but they
would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
camp-fire.",mark
"""AIN'T it gay?""",mark
said Joe.,mark
"""It's NUTS!""",mark
said Tom.,mark
"""What would the boys say if they could see us?""",mark
"""Say?",mark
"Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!""",mark
"""I reckon so,"" said Huckleberry; ""anyways, I'm suited.",mark
"I don't want
nothing better'n this.",mark
"I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and
here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.""",mark
"""It's just the life for me,"" said Tom.",mark
"""You don't have to get up,
mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that
blame foolishness.",mark
"You see a pirate don't have to do ANYTHING, Joe,
when he's ashore, but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable, and
then he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.""",mark
"""Oh yes, that's so,"" said Joe, ""but I hadn't thought much about it,
you know.",mark
"I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.""",mark
"""You see,"" said Tom, ""people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like
they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected.",mark
"And a
hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--""

""What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?""",mark
inquired Huck.,mark
"""I dono.",mark
But they've GOT to do it.,mark
Hermits always do.,mark
"You'd have to do
that if you was a hermit.""",mark
"""Dern'd if I would,"" said Huck.",mark
"""Well, what would you do?""",mark
"""I dono.",mark
"But I wouldn't do that.""",mark
"""Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to.",mark
"How'd you get around it?""",mark
"""Why, I just wouldn't stand it.",mark
"I'd run away.""",mark
"""Run away!",mark
"Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit.",mark
"You'd be
a disgrace.""",mark
"The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed.",mark
"He had
finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded
it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a
cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious
contentment.",mark
"The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and
secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.",mark
"Presently Huck said:

""What does pirates have to do?""",mark
"Tom said:

""Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get
the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's
ghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make
'em walk a plank.""",mark
"""And they carry the women to the island,"" said Joe; ""they don't kill
the women.""",mark
"""No,"" assented Tom, ""they don't kill the women--they're too noble.",mark
"And
the women's always beautiful, too.",mark
"""And don't they wear the bulliest clothes!",mark
Oh no!,mark
"All gold and silver
and di'monds,"" said Joe, with enthusiasm.",mark
"""Who?""",mark
said Huck.,mark
"""Why, the pirates.""",mark
Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.,mark
"""I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,"" said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; ""but I ain't got none but these.""",mark
"But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
after they should have begun their adventures.",mark
"They made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.",mark
"Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs.",mark
"The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the
weary.",mark
"The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main
had more difficulty in getting to sleep.",mark
"They said their prayers
inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority
to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to
say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as
that, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from
heaven.",mark
"Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge
of sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not ""down.""",mark
"It was
conscience.",mark
"They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing
wrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then
the real torture came.",mark
"They tried to argue it away by reminding
conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of
times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin
plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no
getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only
""hooking,"" while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain
simple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible.",mark
"So
they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business,
their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.",mark
"Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent
pirates fell peacefully to sleep.",mark
"CHAPTER XIV

WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was.",mark
"He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around.",mark
Then he comprehended.,mark
"It was the
cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in
the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods.",mark
"Not a leaf stirred;
not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation.",mark
"Beaded dewdrops
stood upon the leaves and grasses.",mark
"A white layer of ashes covered the
fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air.",mark
"Joe
and Huck still slept.",mark
"Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard.",mark
"Gradually the cool dim gray of
the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself.",mark
"The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to
work unfolded itself to the musing boy.",mark
"A little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and ""sniffing around,"" then proceeding again--for he
was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and
began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform.",mark
"Now a procession of ants appeared,
from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk.",mark
"A brown spotted lady-bug
climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to
it and said, ""Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire,
your children's alone,"" and she took wing and went off to see about it
--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its
simplicity more than once.",mark
"A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at
its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against
its body and pretend to be dead.",mark
"The birds were fairly rioting by this
time.",mark
"A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head,
and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of
enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and
stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one
side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel
and a big fellow of the ""fox"" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at
intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had
probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to
be afraid or not.",mark
"All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long
lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near,
and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.",mark
"Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a
shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar.",mark
"They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water.",mark
"A vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization.",mark
"They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.",mark
"Huck found
a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad
oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a
wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee.",mark
"While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to
hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank
and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward.",mark
"Joe had
not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some
handsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions
enough for quite a family.",mark
"They fried the fish with the bacon, and were
astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before.",mark
"They did
not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is
caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce
open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient
of hunger make, too.",mark
"They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition.",mark
"They
tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines.",mark
"Now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.",mark
"They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
astonished at.",mark
"They discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide.",mark
"They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the
middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp.",mark
"They were too
hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and
then threw themselves down in the shade to talk.",mark
"But the talk soon
began to drag, and then died.",mark
"The stillness, the solemnity that brooded
in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the
spirits of the boys.",mark
They fell to thinking.,mark
"A sort of undefined longing
crept upon them.",mark
"This took dim shape, presently--it was budding
homesickness.",mark
"Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps
and empty hogsheads.",mark
"But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and
none was brave enough to speak his thought.",mark
"For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of.",mark
"But now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced, and forced a recognition.",mark
"The boys started,
glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.",mark
"There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen
boom came floating down out of the distance.",mark
"﻿CHAPTER XVIII

THAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his
brother pirates and attend their own funerals.",mark
"They had paddled over to
the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six
miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the
town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and
alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a
chaos of invalided benches.",mark
"At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
Tom, and very attentive to his wants.",mark
"There was an unusual amount of
talk.",mark
"In the course of it Aunt Polly said:

""Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity
you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so.",mark
"If you could come
over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give
me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.""",mark
"""Yes, you could have done that, Tom,"" said Mary; ""and I believe you
would if you had thought of it.""",mark
"""Would you, Tom?""",mark
"said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully.",mark
"""Say,
now, would you, if you'd thought of it?""",mark
"""I--well, I don't know.",mark
"'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.""",mark
"""Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,"" said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy.",mark
"""It would have been something if you'd
cared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it.""",mark
"""Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,"" pleaded Mary; ""it's only Tom's
giddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of
anything.""",mark
"""More's the pity.",mark
Sid would have thought.,mark
"And Sid would have come and
DONE it, too.",mark
"Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and
wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little.""",mark
"""Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,"" said Tom.",mark
"""I'd know it better if you acted more like it.""",mark
"""I wish now I'd thought,"" said Tom, with a repentant tone; ""but I
dreamt about you, anyway.",mark
"That's something, ain't it?""",mark
"""It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing.",mark
"What did you dream?""",mark
"""Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.""",mark
"""Well, so we did.",mark
So we always do.,mark
"I'm glad your dreams could take
even that much trouble about us.""",mark
"""And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.""",mark
"""Why, she was here!",mark
"Did you dream any more?""",mark
"""Oh, lots.",mark
"But it's so dim, now.""",mark
"""Well, try to recollect--can't you?""",mark
"""Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--""

""Try harder, Tom!",mark
The wind did blow something.,mark
"Come!""",mark
"Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
said:

""I've got it now!",mark
I've got it now!,mark
"It blowed the candle!""",mark
"""Mercy on us!",mark
"Go on, Tom--go on!""",mark
"""And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'""

believed the door was open.""",mark

"What did I make him do?""",mark
"""You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.""",mark

days!",mark

get around THIS with her rubbage 'bout superstition.",mark
"Go on, Tom!""",mark
"""Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now.",mark

warn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more
responsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.""",mark
"""And so it was!",mark
"Well, goodness gracious!",mark
"Go on, Tom!""",mark
"""And then you began to cry.""",mark
"""So I did.",mark
So I did.,mark
"Not the first time, neither.",mark

and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd
throwed it out her own self--""

was doing!",mark

to, but if I'd been better sometimes--""

"""And you shut him up sharp.""",mark
"""I lay I did!",mark
There must 'a' been an angel there.,mark
"There WAS an angel
there, somewheres!""",mark
"""And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and
you told about Peter and the Painkiller--""

""Just as true as I live!""",mark
"""And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for
us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss
Harper hugged and cried, and she went.""",mark
"""It happened just so!",mark
"It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in
these very tracks.",mark
"Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a'
seen it!",mark
And then what?,mark
"Go on, Tom!""",mark
"""Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every
word you said.",mark
"And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and
wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off
being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you
looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned
over and kissed you on the lips.""",mark
"""Did you, Tom, DID you!",mark
"I just forgive you everything for that!""",mark

she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
guiltiest of villains.",mark

just audibly.",mark

was awake.",mark

you was ever found again--now go 'long to school.",mark
"I'm thankful to the
good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering
and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though
goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His
blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's
few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
night comes.",mark
"Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've
hendered me long enough.""",mark
"The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream.",mark
"Sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
house.",mark
"It was this: ""Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any
mistakes in it!""",mark
"What a hero Tom was become, now!",mark
"He did not go skipping and prancing,
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on him.",mark
"And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food
and drink to him.",mark
"Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as
proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the
drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie
into town.",mark
"Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away
at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless.",mark
"They would
have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his
glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
circus.",mark
"At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not
long in becoming insufferably ""stuck-up.""",mark
"They began to tell their
adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing
likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
material.",mark
"And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.",mark
Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now.,mark
"Glory
was sufficient.",mark
He would live for glory.,mark
"Now that he was distinguished,
maybe she would be wanting to ""make up.""",mark
"Well, let her--she should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other people.",mark
"Presently she
arrived.",mark
Tom pretended not to see her.,mark
"He moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to talk.",mark
"Soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such times, too.",mark
"It gratified all the vicious
vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only ""set
him up"" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that
he knew she was about.",mark
"Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward Tom.",mark
"Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else.",mark
"She felt a sharp
pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once.",mark
"She tried to go away, but
her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead.",mark
"She
said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:

""Why, Mary Austin!",mark
"you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?""",mark
"""I did come--didn't you see me?""",mark
"""Why, no!",mark
Did you?,mark
"Where did you sit?""",mark
"""I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go.",mark
"I saw YOU.""",mark
"""Did you?",mark
"Why, it's funny I didn't see you.",mark
"I wanted to tell you about
the picnic.""",mark
"""Oh, that's jolly.",mark
"Who's going to give it?""",mark
"""My ma's going to let me have one.""",mark
"""Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come.""",mark
"""Well, she will.",mark
The picnic's for me.,mark
"She'll let anybody come that I
want, and I want you.""",mark
"""That's ever so nice.",mark
"When is it going to be?""",mark
"""By and by.",mark
"Maybe about vacation.""",mark
"""Oh, won't it be fun!",mark
"You going to have all the girls and boys?""",mark
"""Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be""; and she glanced
ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
about the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree ""all to flinders"" while he was ""standing within
three feet of it.""",mark
"""Oh, may I come?""",mark
said Grace Miller.,mark
"""Yes.""",mark
"""And me?""",mark
said Sally Rogers.,mark
"""Yes.""",mark
"""And me, too?""",mark
said Susy Harper.,mark
"""And Joe?""",mark
"""Yes.""",mark
"And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but Tom and Amy.",mark
"Then Tom turned coolly away, still
talking, and took Amy with him.",mark
"Becky's lips trembled and the tears
came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call ""a good cry.""",mark
"Then she sat moody, with wounded
pride, till the bell rang.",mark
"She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
SHE'D do.",mark
"At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction.",mark
"And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
her with the performance.",mark
"At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
falling of his mercury.",mark
"She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so
absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.",mark
Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins.,mark
"He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation.",mark
"He
called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of.",mark
"He
wanted to cry with vexation.",mark
"Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function.",mark
"He
did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he
could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as
otherwise.",mark
"He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there.",mark
"He could
not help it.",mark
"And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
living.",mark
"But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.",mark
Amy's happy prattle became intolerable.,mark
"Tom hinted at things he had to
attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting.",mark
"But in
vain--the girl chirped on.",mark
"Tom thought, ""Oh, hang her, ain't I ever
going to get rid of her?""",mark
"At last he must be attending to those
things--and she said artlessly that she would be ""around"" when school
let out.",mark
"And he hastened away, hating her for it.",mark
"""Any other boy!""",mark
"Tom thought, grating his teeth.",mark
"""Any boy in the whole
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
aristocracy!",mark
"Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw
this town, mister, and I'll lick you again!",mark
"You just wait till I catch
you out!",mark
"I'll just take and--""

And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy
--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging.",mark
"""Oh, you do, do you?",mark
"You
holler 'nough, do you?",mark
"Now, then, let that learn you!""",mark
"And so the
imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.",mark
Tom fled home at noon.,mark
"His conscience could not endure any more of
Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the
other distress.",mark
"Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but
as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph
began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness
followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her
ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came.",mark
"﻿CHAPTER XXIII

AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court.",mark
"It became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately.",mark
Tom could not get away from it.,mark
"Every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and
fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his
hearing as ""feelers""; he did not see how he could be suspected of
knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be
comfortable in the midst of this gossip.",mark
"It kept him in a cold shiver
all the time.",mark
He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.,mark
"It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to
divide his burden of distress with another sufferer.",mark
"Moreover, he
wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.",mark
"""Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?""",mark
"""'Bout what?""",mark
"""You know what.""",mark
"""Oh--'course I haven't.""",mark
"""Never a word?""",mark
"""Never a solitary word, so help me.",mark
"What makes you ask?""",mark
"""Well, I was afeard.""",mark
"""Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.",mark
"YOU know that.""",mark
Tom felt more comfortable.,mark
"After a pause:

""Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?""",mark
"""Get me to tell?",mark
"Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me
they could get me to tell.",mark
"They ain't no different way.""",mark
"""Well, that's all right, then.",mark
"I reckon we're safe as long as we keep
mum.",mark
"But let's swear again, anyway.",mark
"It's more surer.""",mark
"""I'm agreed.""",mark
So they swore again with dread solemnities.,mark
"""What is the talk around, Huck?",mark
"I've heard a power of it.""",mark
"""Talk?",mark
"Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
time.",mark
"It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.""",mark
"""That's just the same way they go on round me.",mark
I reckon he's a goner.,mark
"Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?""",mark
"""Most always--most always.",mark
"He ain't no account; but then he hain't
ever done anything to hurt anybody.",mark
"Just fishes a little, to get money
to get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like.",mark
"But he's kind of
good--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two;
and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.""",mark
"""Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my
line.",mark
"I wish we could get him out of there.""",mark
"""My!",mark
"we couldn't get him out, Tom.",mark
"And besides, 'twouldn't do any
good; they'd ketch him again.""",mark
"""Yes--so they would.",mark
"But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the
dickens when he never done--that.""",mark
"""I do too, Tom.",mark
"Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking
villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.""",mark
"""Yes, they talk like that, all the time.",mark
"I've heard 'em say that if he
was to get free they'd lynch him.""",mark
"""And they'd do it, too.""",mark
"The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort.",mark
"As the
twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties.",mark
"But
nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive.",mark
"The boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating
and gave Potter some tobacco and matches.",mark
"He was on the ground floor
and there were no guards.",mark
"His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
before--it cut deeper than ever, this time.",mark
"They felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when Potter said:

""You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this
town.",mark
"And I don't forget it, I don't.",mark
"Often I says to myself, says I,
'I used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the
good fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've
all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck
don't--THEY don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.'",mark
"Well,
boys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the
only way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's
right.",mark
"Right, and BEST, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway.",mark
"Well, we won't
talk about that.",mark
"I don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've befriended
me.",mark
"But what I want to say, is, don't YOU ever get drunk--then you won't
ever get here.",mark
"Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime
comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of
trouble, and there don't none come here but yourn.",mark
"Good friendly
faces--good friendly faces.",mark
"Git up on one another's backs and let me
touch 'em.",mark
That's it.,mark
"Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but
mine's too big.",mark
"Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter
a power, and they'd help him more if they could.""",mark
"Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of
horrors.",mark
"The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room,
drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself
to stay out.",mark
Huck was having the same experience.,mark
"They studiously
avoided each other.",mark
"Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same
dismal fascination always brought them back presently.",mark
"Tom kept his
ears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room, but invariably
heard distressing news--the toils were closing more and more
relentlessly around poor Potter.",mark
"At the end of the second day the
village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and
unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the
jury's verdict would be.",mark
"Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window.",mark
"He
was in a tremendous state of excitement.",mark
"It was hours before he got to
sleep.",mark
"All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for
this was to be the great day.",mark
"Both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience.",mark
"After a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
stolid as ever.",mark
"There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court.",mark
"The usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed.",mark
"These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.",mark
"Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter
washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder
was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away.",mark
"After some
further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:

""Take the witness.""",mark
"The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
his own counsel said:

""I have no questions to ask him.""",mark
The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.,mark
"Counsel for the prosecution said:

""Take the witness.""",mark
"""I have no questions to ask him,"" Potter's lawyer replied.",mark
"A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's
possession.",mark
"""Take the witness.""",mark
Counsel for Potter declined to question him.,mark
"The faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance.",mark
"Did this attorney mean to throw away his
client's life without an effort?",mark
"Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder.",mark
"They were allowed to leave the
stand without being cross-questioned.",mark
"Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
by Potter's lawyer.",mark
"The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.",mark
"Counsel for the prosecution now said:

""By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we
have fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question,
upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar.",mark
"We rest our case here.""",mark
"A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in
the court-room.",mark
"Many men were moved, and many women's compassion
testified itself in tears.",mark
"Counsel for the defence rose and said:

""Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium
produced by drink.",mark
We have changed our mind.,mark
"We shall not offer that
plea.""",mark
"[Then to the clerk:] ""Call Thomas Sawyer!""",mark
"A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even
excepting Potter's.",mark
"Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest
upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand.",mark
"The boy looked
wild enough, for he was badly scared.",mark
The oath was administered.,mark
"""Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
hour of midnight?""",mark
Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him.,mark
"The
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come.",mark
"After a
few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and
managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house
hear:

""In the graveyard!""",mark
"""A little bit louder, please.",mark
Don't be afraid.,mark
"You were--""

""In the graveyard.""",mark
A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.,mark
"""Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?""",mark
"""Yes, sir.""",mark
"""Speak up--just a trifle louder.",mark
"How near were you?""",mark
"""Near as I am to you.""",mark
"""Were you hidden, or not?""",mark
"""I was hid.""",mark
"""Where?""",mark
"""Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.""",mark
Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.,mark
"""Any one with you?""",mark
"""Yes, sir.",mark
"I went there with--""

""Wait--wait a moment.",mark
Never mind mentioning your companion's name.,mark
"We
will produce him at the proper time.",mark
"Did you carry anything there with
you.""",mark
Tom hesitated and looked confused.,mark
"""Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident.",mark
"The truth is always
respectable.",mark
"What did you take there?""",mark
"""Only a--a--dead cat.""",mark
"There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.",mark
"""We will produce the skeleton of that cat.",mark
"Now, my boy, tell us
everything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything,
and don't be afraid.""",mark
"Tom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips
and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of
time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale.",mark
"The strain upon
pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:

""--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,
Injun Joe jumped with the knife and--""

Crash!",mark
"Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his
way through all opposers, and was gone!",mark
"CHAPTER XXIV

TOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of
the young.",mark
"His name even went into immortal print, for the village
paper magnified him.",mark
"There were some that believed he would be
President, yet, if he escaped hanging.",mark
"As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before.",mark
"But that sort
of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.",mark
"Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror.",mark
"Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye.",mark
"Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to
stir abroad after nightfall.",mark
"Poor Huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
Injun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.",mark
"The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
that?",mark
"Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's
confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.",mark
"Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.",mark
"Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be.",mark
"He felt sure he never could draw
a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.",mark
"Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
Joe was found.",mark
"One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head,
looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of
that craft usually achieve.",mark
"That is to say, he ""found a clew.""",mark
"But you
can't hang a ""clew"" for murder, and so after that detective had got
through and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.",mark
"The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.",mark
"CHAPTER XXV

THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.",mark
"This
desire suddenly came upon Tom one day.",mark
"He sallied out to find Joe
Harper, but failed of success.",mark
"Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone
fishing.",mark
Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed.,mark
"Huck
would answer.",mark
"Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to
him confidentially.",mark
Huck was willing.,mark
"Huck was always willing to take a
hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no
capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time
which is not money.",mark
"""Where'll we dig?""",mark
said Huck.,mark
"""Oh, most anywhere.""",mark
"""Why, is it hid all around?""",mark
"""No, indeed it ain't.",mark
"It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck
--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a
limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but
mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.""",mark
"""Who hides it?""",mark
"""Why, robbers, of course--who'd you reckon?",mark

sup'rintendents?""",mark
"""I don't know.",mark

a good time.""",mark
"""So would I.",mark
But robbers don't do that way.,mark
"They always hide it and
leave it there.""",mark
"""Don't they come after it any more?""",mark
"""No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or
else they die.",mark
"Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by
and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the
marks--a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's
mostly signs and hy'roglyphics.""",mark
"""HyroQwhich?""",mark
"""Hy'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean
anything.""",mark
"""Have you got one of them papers, Tom?""",mark
"""No.""",mark

THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure.",mark
"They hung
about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the
alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.",mark
"Nobody entered the
alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the
tavern door.",mark
"The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with
the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on,
Huck was to come and ""maow,"" whereupon he would slip out and try the
keys.",mark
"But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and
retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.",mark
Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck.,mark
Also Wednesday.,mark
"But Thursday
night promised better.",mark
"Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's
old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with.",mark
"He hid the
lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began.",mark
"An hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones
thereabouts) were put out.",mark
No Spaniard had been seen.,mark
"Nobody had
entered or left the alley.",mark
Everything was auspicious.,mark
"The blackness of
darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by
occasional mutterings of distant thunder.",mark
"Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.",mark
Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.,mark
"Then there was a
season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a
mountain.",mark
"He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it
would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
yet.",mark
It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared.,mark
"Surely he must have
fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement.",mark
"In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and
closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his breath.",mark
"There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
way it was beating.",mark
"Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
tearing by him: ""Run!""",mark
"said he; ""run, for your life!""",mark
"He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty
or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.",mark
"The boys
never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house
at the lower end of the village.",mark
"Just as they got within its shelter
the storm burst and the rain poured down.",mark
"As soon as Tom got his breath
he said:

""Huck, it was awful!",mark
"I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly
get my breath I was so scared.",mark
"They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.",mark
"Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
open comes the door!",mark
It warn't locked!,mark

towel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!""",mark
"""What!--what'd you see, Tom?""",mark

"""No!""",mark
"""Yes!",mark

patch on his eye and his arms spread out.""",mark
"""Lordy, what did you do?",mark

"""No, never budged.",mark

started!""",mark

floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the
room.",mark

"""How?""",mark
"""Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey!",mark

"If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.""",mark
"There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:

""Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
Joe's not in there.",mark
It's too scary.,mark
"Now, if we watch every night, we'll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll
snatch that box quicker'n lightning.""",mark
"""Well, I'm agreed.",mark
"I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it
every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.""",mark
"""All right, I will.",mark
"All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
block and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
and that'll fetch me.""",mark
"""Agreed, and good as wheat!""",mark
"""Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home.",mark
"It'll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours.",mark
"You go back and watch that long, will
you?""",mark
"""I said I would, Tom, and I will.",mark
"I'll ha'nt that tavern every night
for a year!",mark
"I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.""",mark
"""That's all right.",mark
"Now, where you going to sleep?""",mark
"""In Ben Rogers' hayloft.",mark
"He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,
Uncle Jake.",mark
"I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and
any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can
spare it.",mark
"That's a mighty good nigger, Tom.",mark
"He likes me, becuz I don't
ever act as if I was above him.",mark
"Sometime I've set right down and eat
WITH him.",mark
But you needn't tell that.,mark
"A body's got to do things when
he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.""",mark
"""Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep.",mark

"CHAPTER XXIX

THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news
--Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before.",mark
"Both
Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment,
and Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest.",mark
"He saw her and
they had an exhausting good time playing ""hi-spy"" and ""gully-keeper""
with a crowd of their school-mates.",mark
"The day was completed and crowned
in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented.",mark
"The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more
moderate.",mark
"The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable anticipation.",mark
"Tom's excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's
""maow,"" and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
with, next day; but he was disappointed.",mark
No signal came that night.,mark
"Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything
was ready for a start.",mark
"It was not the custom for elderly people to mar
the picnics with their presence.",mark
"The children were considered safe
enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few
young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts.",mark
"The old steam ferryboat
was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the
main street laden with provision-baskets.",mark
"Sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him.",mark
"The last thing Mrs.
Thatcher said to Becky, was:

""You'll not get back till late.",mark
"Perhaps you'd better stay all night
with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.""",mark
"""Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.""",mark
"""Very well.",mark
"And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.""",mark
"Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:

""Say--I'll tell you what we'll do.",mark
"'Stead of going to Joe Harper's
we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'.",mark
"She'll
have ice-cream!",mark
She has it most every day--dead loads of it.,mark
"And she'll
be awful glad to have us.""",mark
"""Oh, that will be fun!""",mark
"Then Becky reflected a moment and said:

""But what will mamma say?""",mark
"""How'll she ever know?""",mark
"The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

""I reckon it's wrong--but--""

""But shucks!",mark
"Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?",mark
"All she
wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if
she'd 'a' thought of it.",mark
"I know she would!""",mark
The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait.,mark
"It and
Tom's persuasions presently carried the day.",mark
"So it was decided to say
nothing anybody about the night's programme.",mark
"Presently it occurred to
Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal.",mark
"The
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations.",mark
"Still he
could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'.",mark
"And why should he
give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so
why should it be any more likely to come to-night?",mark
"The sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day.",mark
"Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up.",mark
"The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
laughter.",mark
"All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
began.",mark
"After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat
in the shade of spreading oaks.",mark
"By-and-by somebody shouted:

""Who's ready for the cave?""",mark
Everybody was.,mark
"Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
was a general scamper up the hill.",mark
"The mouth of the cave was up the
hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A.",mark
"Its massive oaken door
stood unbarred.",mark
"Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and
walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.",mark
"It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look
out upon the green valley shining in the sun.",mark
"But the impressiveness of
the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again.",mark
"The moment
a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon
knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter
and a new chase.",mark
But all things have an end.,mark
"By-and-by the procession
went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering
rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their
point of junction sixty feet overhead.",mark
"This main avenue was not more
than eight or ten feet wide.",mark
"Every few steps other lofty and still
narrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave
was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and
out again and led nowhere.",mark
"It was said that one might wander days and
nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and
never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down,
and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth
under labyrinth, and no end to any of them.",mark
"No man ""knew"" the cave.",mark
That was an impossible thing.,mark
"Most of the young men knew a portion of
it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.",mark
Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.,mark
"The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a
mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by
surprise at points where the corridors joined again.",mark
"Parties were able
to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond
the ""known"" ground.",mark
"By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
the day.",mark
"Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no
note of time and that night was about at hand.",mark
"The clanging bell had
been calling for half an hour.",mark
"However, this sort of close to the day's
adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory.",mark
"When the ferryboat
with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft.",mark
"Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went
glinting past the wharf.",mark
"He heard no noise on board, for the young
people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
tired to death.",mark
"He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop
at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
attention upon his business.",mark
The night was growing cloudy and dark.,mark
"Ten
o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
silence and the ghosts.",mark
"Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were
put out; darkness everywhere, now.",mark
"Huck waited what seemed a weary long
time, but nothing happened.",mark
His faith was weakening.,mark
Was there any use?,mark
Was there really any use?,mark
Why not give it up and turn in?,mark
A noise fell upon his ear.,mark
He was all attention in an instant.,mark
"The
alley door closed softly.",mark
He sprang to the corner of the brick store.,mark
"The next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have
something under his arm.",mark
It must be that box!,mark
"So they were going to
remove the treasure.",mark
Why call Tom now?,mark
"It would be absurd--the men
would get away with the box and never be found again.",mark
"No, he would
stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for
security from discovery.",mark
"So communing with himself, Huck stepped out
and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing
them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.",mark
"They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left
up a cross-street.",mark
"They went straight ahead, then, until they came to
the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took.",mark
"They passed by the
old Welshman's house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and
still climbed upward.",mark
"Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old
quarry.",mark
But they never stopped at the quarry.,mark
"They passed on, up the
summit.",mark
"They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach
bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom.",mark
"Huck closed up and
shortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him.",mark
"He trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was
gaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened;
no sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own
heart.",mark
The hooting of an owl came over the hill--ominous sound!,mark
"But no
footsteps.",mark
"Heavens, was everything lost!",mark
"He was about to spring with
winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him!",mark
"Huck's heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then
he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at
once, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground.",mark
"He
knew where he was.",mark
"He knew he was within five steps of the stile
leading into Widow Douglas' grounds.",mark
"Very well, he thought, let them
bury it there; it won't be hard to find.",mark
"Now there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:

""Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.""",mark
"""I can't see any.""",mark
"﻿CHAPTER XXXII

TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight.",mark
"The village of St.
Petersburg still mourned.",mark
The lost children had not been found.,mark
"Public
prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private
prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good
news came from the cave.",mark
"The majority of the searchers had given up the
quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain
the children could never be found.",mark
"Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a
great part of the time delirious.",mark
"People said it was heartbreaking to
hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute
at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan.",mark
"Aunt Polly had
drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost
white.",mark
"The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.",mark
"Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
people, who shouted, ""Turn out!",mark
turn out!,mark
they're found!,mark
"they're
found!""",mark
"Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed
itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open
carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its
homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring
huzzah after huzzah!",mark
"The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen.",mark
"During the first half-hour
a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized
the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to
speak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.",mark
"Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so.",mark
"It
would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with
the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband.",mark
"Tom lay
upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of
the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on
an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of
the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
Mississippi rolling by!",mark
"And if it had only happened to be night he would
not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that
passage any more!",mark
"He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good
news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was
tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to.",mark
"He described how he
labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when
she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how
he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat
there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom
hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition;
how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, ""because,"" said they,
""you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in""
--then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them
rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.",mark
"Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung
behind them, and informed of the great news.",mark
"Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be
shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered.",mark
"They were
bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
more tired and worn, all the time.",mark
"Tom got about, a little, on
Thursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday;
but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as
if she had passed through a wasting illness.",mark
"Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but
could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or
Sunday.",mark
"He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still
about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic.",mark
"The Widow Douglas
stayed by to see that he obeyed.",mark
"At home Tom learned of the Cardiff
Hill event; also that the ""ragged man's"" body had eventually been found
in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying
to escape, perhaps.",mark
"About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to
visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought.",mark
"Judge
Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky.",mark
"The
Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again.",mark
"Tom said he
thought he wouldn't mind it.",mark
"The Judge said:

""Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.",mark
But we have taken care of that.,mark
"Nobody will get lost in that cave any
more.""",mark
"""Why?""",mark
"""Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,
and triple-locked--and I've got the keys.""",mark
Tom turned as white as a sheet.,mark
"""What's the matter, boy!",mark
"Here, run, somebody!",mark
"Fetch a glass of water!""",mark
The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.,mark
"""Ah, now you're all right.",mark
"What was the matter with you, Tom?""",mark
"""Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!""",mark
"CHAPTER XXXIII

WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well
filled with passengers, soon followed.",mark
"Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that
bore Judge Thatcher.",mark
"When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place.",mark
"Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside.",mark
"Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered.",mark
"His pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.",mark
"Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two.",mark
"The
great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through,
with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock
formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had
wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself.",mark
"But if
there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been
useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could
not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it.",mark
"So he had
only hacked that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass
the weary time--in order to employ his tortured faculties.",mark
"Ordinarily
one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices
of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now.",mark
"The
prisoner had searched them out and eaten them.",mark
"He had also contrived to
catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their
claws.",mark
The poor unfortunate had starved to death.,mark
"In one place, near at
hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,
builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead.",mark
"The captive had
broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone,
wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop
that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a
clock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours.",mark
"That drop
was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the
foundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified; when the
Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the
massacre at Lexington was ""news.""",mark
"It is falling now; it will still be
falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of
history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the
thick night of oblivion.",mark
Has everything a purpose and a mission?,mark
"Did
this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for
this flitting human insect's need?",mark
"and has it another important object
to accomplish ten thousand years to come?",mark
No matter.,mark
"It is many and
many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch
the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that
pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the
wonders of McDougal's cave.",mark
"Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of
the cavern's marvels; even ""Aladdin's Palace"" cannot rival it.",mark
"Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all
sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging.",mark
"This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to
the governor for Injun Joe's pardon.",mark
"The petition had been largely
signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a
committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail
around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample
his duty under foot.",mark
"Injun Joe was believed to have killed five
citizens of the village, but what of that?",mark
"If he had been Satan himself
there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names
to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently
impaired and leaky water-works.",mark
"The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
an important talk.",mark
"Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the
Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he
wanted to talk about now.",mark
Huck's face saddened.,mark
"He said:

""I know what it is.",mark
You got into No.,mark
"2 and never found anything but
whiskey.",mark
"Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben
you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else.",mark
"Tom, something's always
told me we'd never get holt of that swag.""",mark
"""Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper.",mark
"YOU know his tavern
was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic.",mark
"Don't you remember you
was to watch there that night?""",mark
"""Oh yes!",mark
"Why, it seems 'bout a year ago.",mark
"It was that very night that I
follered Injun Joe to the widder's.""",mark
"""YOU followed him?""",mark
"""Yes--but you keep mum.",mark
"I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,
and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks.",mark
"If it
hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.""",mark
"Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
heard of the Welshman's part of it before.",mark
"""Well,"" said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
""whoever nipped the whiskey in No.",mark
"2, nipped the money, too, I reckon
--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.""",mark
"""Huck, that money wasn't ever in No.",mark
"2!""",mark
"""What!""",mark
Huck searched his comrade's face keenly.,mark
"""Tom, have you got on
the track of that money again?""",mark
"""Huck, it's in the cave!""",mark
Huck's eyes blazed.,mark
"""Say it again, Tom.""",mark
"""The money's in the cave!""",mark
"""Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?""",mark
"""Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life.",mark
"Will you go
in there with me and help get it out?""",mark
"""I bet I will!",mark
"I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not
get lost.""",mark
"""Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
world.""",mark
"""Good as wheat!",mark
"What makes you think the money's--""

""Huck, you just wait till we get in there.",mark
"If we don't find it I'll
agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world.",mark
"I
will, by jings.""",mark
"""All right--it's a whiz.",mark
"When do you say?""",mark
"""Right now, if you say it.",mark
"Are you strong enough?""",mark
"""Is it far in the cave?",mark
"I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.""",mark
"""It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go,
Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me
know about.",mark
"Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff.",mark
"I'll float the
skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself.",mark
"You
needn't ever turn your hand over.""",mark
"""Less start right off, Tom.""",mark
"""All right.",mark
"We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these
new-fangled things they call lucifer matches.",mark
"I tell you, many's
the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.""",mark
"A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
was absent, and got under way at once.",mark
"When they were several miles
below ""Cave Hollow,"" Tom said:

""Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.",mark
"But do you see
that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide?",mark
"Well, that's
one of my marks.",mark
"We'll get ashore, now.""",mark
They landed.,mark
"""Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
of with a fishing-pole.",mark
"See if you can find it.""",mark
"Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing.",mark

marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

""Here you are!",mark
"Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this
country.",mark
You just keep mum about it.,mark
"All along I've been wanting to be
a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to
run across it was the bother.",mark

"""No, not always.",mark

"""What's a ransom?""",mark
"""Money.",mark
"You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and
after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them.",mark
That's the general way.,mark
Only you don't kill the women.,mark
"You shut up the
women, but you don't kill them.",mark
"They're always beautiful and rich, and
awfully scared.",mark
"You take their watches and things, but you always take
your hat off and talk polite.",mark
"They ain't anybody as polite as robbers

"Well, the women get to loving you, and
after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and
after that you couldn't get them to leave.",mark
"If you drove them out they'd

"""Yes--leave it.",mark

to the Reader.",mark
"There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be destroyed
by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless.",mark

his character is about perfect, he is the choicest spirit among all the
humbler animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to.",mark

doubt.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.",mark
"A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make
mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen; and so
I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press
without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and
correction by a trained barrister--if that is what they are called.",mark
"These chapters are right, now, in every detail, for they were rewritten
under the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a
while in southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over
here to Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and
board in Macaroni Vermicelli's horse-feed shed which is up the back
alley as you turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just
beyond the house where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred
years ago is let into the wall when he let on to be watching them build
Giotto's campanile and yet always got tired looking as soon as Beatrice
passed along on her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend
herself with in case of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school,
at the same old stand where they sell the same old cake to this day and
it is just as light and good as it was then, too, and this is not
flattery, far from it.",mark

Viviani, village of Settignano, three miles back of Florence, on the

on this planet, and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to
be found in any planet or even in any solar system--and given, too, in
the swell room of the house, with the busts of Cerretani senators and
other grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me as they
used to look down upon Dante, and mutely asking me to adopt them into my
family, which I do with pleasure, for my remotest ancestors are but
spring chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques, and it
will be a great and satisfying lift for me, that six hundred years will.",mark

"CHAPTER I.

Pudd'nhead Wins His Name.",mark
"Tell the truth or trump--but get the trick.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's
Calendar.",mark
"The scene of this chronicle is the town of Dawson's Landing, on the
Missouri side of the Mississippi, half a day's journey, per steamboat,
below St. Louis.",mark
"In 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story
frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from
sight by climbing tangles of rose-vines, honeysuckles, and
morning-glories.",mark
"Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced
with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds,
touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers; while
on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing
moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium
whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint
of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame.",mark
"When there was
room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was
there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful,
with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose.",mark
"Then
that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made
manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible.",mark
"A
home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered
cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?",mark
"All along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick
sidewalks, stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing,
and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring
when the clusters of buds came forth.",mark
"The main street, one block back
from the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business
street.",mark
"It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick
stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little
frame shops.",mark
"Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole
length.",mark
"The candy-striped pole which indicates nobility proud and
ancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the
humble barber shop along the main street of Dawson's Landing.",mark
"On a chief
corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin
pots and pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world
(when the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that
corner.",mark
"The hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river;
its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most
rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the
base-line of the hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town in a
half-moon curve, clothed with forests from foot to summit.",mark
Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so.,mark
"Those belonging to the
little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big
Orleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight;
and this was the case also with the great flotilla of ""transients.""",mark
"These latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the
Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red
River, the White River, and so on; and were bound every whither and
stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the
Mississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St.
Anthony down through nine climates to torrid New Orleans.",mark
"Dawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich slave-worked grain
and pork country back of it.",mark
"The town was sleepy and comfortable and
contented.",mark
"It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly,
in fact, but still it was growing.",mark
"The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old,
judge of the county court.",mark
"He was very proud of his old Virginian
ancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately
manners he kept up its traditions.",mark
He was fine and just and generous.,mark
"To
be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only
religion, and to it he was always faithful.",mark
"He was respected, esteemed
and beloved by all the community.",mark
"He was well off, and was gradually
adding to his store.",mark
"He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not
quite, for they had no children.",mark
"The longing for the treasure of a child
had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the
blessing never came--and was never to come.",mark
"With this pair lived the Judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and
she also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and
not to be comforted.",mark
"The women were good and commonplace people, and did
their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's
approbation.",mark
"They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a free-thinker.",mark
"Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged about forty, was another old
Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families.",mark
"He was a
fine, brave, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest
requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority
on the ""code,"" and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you
in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious
to you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls
to artillery.",mark
"He was very popular with the people, and was the Judge's
dearest friend.",mark
"Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F. F. V. of
formidable caliber--however, with him we have no concern.",mark
"Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the Judge, and younger than he
by five years, was a married man, and had had children around his
hearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup and
scarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective
antediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty.",mark
"He was a prosperous
man, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing.",mark
"On
the 1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house: one to
him, the other to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name.",mark
"Roxana was
twenty years old.",mark
"She was up and around the same day, with her hands
full, for she was tending both babies.",mark
Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week.,mark
"Roxy remained in charge of the
children.",mark
"She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in
his speculations and left her to her own devices.",mark
"In that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen.",mark
"This was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage.",mark
"He had
wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of
the State of New York, to seek his fortune.",mark
"He was twenty-five years
old, college-bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern
law school a couple of years before.",mark
"He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an
intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a
covert twinkle of a pleasant sort.",mark
"But for an unfortunate remark of his,
he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at
Dawson's Landing.",mark
"But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in
the village, and it ""gaged"" him.",mark
"He had just made the acquaintance of a
group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl
and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young
Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud--

""I wish I owned half of that dog.""",mark
"""Why?""",mark
somebody asked.,mark
"""Because I would kill my half.""",mark
"The group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found
no light there, no expression that they could read.",mark
"They fell away from
him as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him.",mark
"One
said:

""'Pears to be a fool.""",mark
"""'Pears?""",mark
said another.,mark
"""Is, I reckon you better say.""",mark
"""Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot,"" said a third.",mark
"""What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his
half?",mark
"Do you reckon he thought it would live?""",mark
"""Why, he must have thought it, unless he is the downrightest fool in the
world; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the
whole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died,
he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed
that half instead of his own.",mark
"Don't it look that way to you, gents?""",mark
"""Yes, it does.",mark
"If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so;
if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end,
it would be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because
if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell
whose half it was, but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could
kill his end of it and--""

""No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other
end died, which it would.",mark
"In my opinion that man ain't in his right
mind.""",mark
"""In my opinion he hain't got any mind.""",mark
No.,mark
"3 said: ""Well, he's a lummox, anyway.""",mark
"""That's what he is,"" said No.",mark
"4, ""he's a labrick--just a Simon-pure
labrick, if ever there was one.""",mark
"""Yes, sir, he's a dam fool, that's the way I put him up,"" said No.",mark
5.,mark
"""Anybody can think different that wants to, but those are my
sentiments.""",mark
"""I'm with you, gentlemen,"" said No.",mark
6.,mark
"""Perfect jackass--yes, and it
ain't going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead.",mark
"If he ain't a pudd'nhead,
I ain't no judge, that's all.""",mark
Mr. Wilson stood elected.,mark
"The incident was told all over the town, and
gravely discussed by everybody.",mark
"Within a week he had lost his first
name; Pudd'nhead took its place.",mark
"In time he came to be liked, and well
liked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it
stayed.",mark
"That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to
get it set aside, or even modified.",mark
"The nickname soon ceased to carry
any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was
to continue to hold its place for twenty long years.",mark
CHAPTER II.,mark
Driscoll Spares His Slaves.,mark
Adam was but human--this explains it all.,mark
"He did not want the apple for
the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden.",mark
"The
mistake was in not forbidding the serpent; then he would have eaten the
serpent.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar.",mark
"Pudd'nhead Wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived, and he bought a
small house on the extreme western verge of the town.",mark
"Between it and
Judge Driscoll's house there was only a grassy yard, with a paling fence
dividing the properties in the middle.",mark
"He hired a small office down in
the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it:

DAVID WILSON.",mark
ATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR-AT-LAW.,mark
"SURVEYING, CONVEYANCING, ETC.",mark
But his deadly remark had ruined his chance--at least in the law.,mark
"No
clients came.",mark
"He took down his sign, after a while, and put it up on his
own house with the law features knocked out of it.",mark
"It offered his
services now in the humble capacities of land-surveyor and expert
accountant.",mark
"Now and then he got a job of surveying to do, and now and
then a merchant got him to straighten out his books.",mark
"With Scotch
patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his
way into the legal field yet.",mark
"Poor fellow, he could not foresee that it
was going to take him such a weary long time to do it.",mark
"He had a rich abundance of idle time, but it never hung heavy on his
hands, for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into
the universe of ideas, and studied it and experimented upon it at his
house.",mark
One of his pet fads was palmistry.,mark
"To another one he gave no
name, neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was, but
merely said it was an amusement.",mark
"In fact he had found that his fads
added to his reputation as a pudd'nhead; therefore he was growing chary
of being too communicative about them.",mark
"The fad without a name was one
which dealt with people's finger-marks.",mark
"He carried in his coat pocket a
shallow box with grooves in it, and in the grooves strips of glass five
inches long and three inches wide.",mark
"Along the lower edge of each strip
was pasted a slip of white paper.",mark
"He asked people to pass their hands
through their hair (thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the
natural oil) and then make a thumb-mark on a glass strip, following it
with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession.",mark
"Under this row
of faint grease-prints he would write a record on the strip of white
paper--thus:

John Smith, right hand--

and add the day of the month and the year, then take Smith's left hand
on another glass strip, and add name and date and the words ""left hand.""",mark
"The strips were now returned to the grooved box, and took their place
among what Wilson called his ""records.""",mark
"He often studied his records, examining and poring over them with
absorbing interest until far into the night; but what he found there--if
he found anything--he revealed to no one.",mark
"Sometimes he copied on paper
the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of a finger, and then
vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of
curving lines with ease and convenience.",mark
"One sweltering afternoon--it was the first day of July, 1830--he was at
work over a set of tangled account-books in his work-room, which looked
westward over a stretch of vacant lots, when a conversation outside
disturbed him.",mark
"It was carried on in yells, which showed that the people
engaged in it were not close together:

""Say, Roxy, how does yo' baby come on?""",mark
This from the distant voice.,mark
"""Fust-rate; how does you come on, Jasper?""",mark
This yell was from close by.,mark
"""Oh, I's middlin'; hain't got noth'n' to complain of.",mark
"I's gwine to come

"Dat's de time I got you!""",mark
"""Oh, yes, you got me, hain't you.",mark
"'Clah to goodness if dat conceit o'

"If you b'longed to
me I'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too fur gone.",mark
"Fust time I
runs acrost yo' marster, I's gwine to tell him so.""",mark
"This idle and aimless jabber went on and on, both parties enjoying the
friendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit
exchanged--for wit they considered it.",mark
"Wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants; he could not
work while their chatter continued.",mark
"Over in the vacant lots was Jasper,
young, coal-black and of magnificent build, sitting on a wheelbarrow in
the pelting sun--at work, supposably, whereas he was in fact only
preparing for it by taking an hour's rest before beginning.",mark
"In front of
Wilson's porch stood Roxy, with a local hand-made baby-wagon, in which
sat her two charges--one at each end and facing each other.",mark
"From Roxy's
manner of speech, a stranger would have expected her to be black, but
she was not.",mark
"Only one sixteenth of her was black, and that sixteenth did
not show.",mark
"She was of majestic form and stature, her attitudes were
imposing and statuesque, and her gestures and movements distinguished by
a noble and stately grace.",mark
"Her complexion was very fair, with the rosy
glow of vigorous health in the cheeks, her face was full of character
and expression, her eyes were brown and liquid, and she had a heavy suit
of fine soft hair which was also brown, but the fact was not apparent
because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the
hair was concealed under it.",mark
"Her face was shapely, intelligent and
comely--even beautiful.",mark
"She had an easy, independent carriage--when she
was among her own caste--and a high and ""sassy"" way, withal; but of
course she was meek and humble enough where white people were.",mark
"To all intents and purposes Roxy was as white as anybody, but the one
sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and
made her a negro.",mark
"She was a slave, and salable as such.",mark
"Her child was
thirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of
law and custom a negro.",mark
"He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white
comrade, but even the father of the white child was able to tell the
children apart--little as he had commerce with them--by their clothes:
for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace, while
the other wore merely a coarse tow-linen shirt which barely reached to
its knees, and no jewelry.",mark
"The white child's name was Thomas à Becket Driscoll, the other's name
was Valet de Chambre: no surname--slaves hadn't the privilege.",mark
"Roxana
had heard that phrase somewhere, the fine sound of it had pleased her
ear, and as she had supposed it was a name, she loaded it on to her
darling.",mark
"It soon got shorted to ""Chambers,"" of course.",mark
"Wilson knew Roxy by sight, and when the duel of wit began to play out,
he stepped outside to gather in a record or two.",mark
"Jasper went to work
energetically, at once, perceiving that his leisure was observed.",mark
"Wilson
inspected the children and asked--

""How old are they, Roxy?""",mark
"""Bofe de same age, sir--five months.",mark
"Bawn de fust o' Feb'uary.""",mark
"""They're handsome little chaps.",mark
"One's just as handsome as the other,
too.""",mark
"A delighted smile exposed the girl's white teeth, and she said:

""Bless yo' soul, Misto Wilson, it's pow'ful nice o' you to say dat,
'ca'se one of 'em ain't on'y a nigger.",mark
"Mighty prime little nigger, I
al'ays says, but dat's 'ca'se it's mine, o' course.""",mark
"""How do you tell them apart, Roxy, when they haven't any clothes on?""",mark
"Roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size, and said:

""Oh, I kin tell 'em 'part, Misto Wilson, but I bet Marse Percy couldn't,
not to save his life.""",mark
"Wilson chatted along for awhile, and presently got Roxy's finger-prints
for his collection--right hand and left--on a couple of his glass
strips; then labeled and dated them, and took the ""records"" of both
children, and labeled and dated them also.",mark
"Two months later, on the 3d of September, he took this trio of
finger-marks again.",mark
"He liked to have a ""series,"" two or three ""takings""
at intervals during the period of childhood, these to be followed by
others at intervals of several years.",mark
"The next day--that is to say, on the 4th of September--something
occurred which profoundly impressed Roxana.",mark
"Mr. Driscoll missed another
small sum of money--which is a way of saying that this was not a new
thing, but had happened before.",mark
"In truth it had happened three times
before.",mark
Driscoll's patience was exhausted.,mark
"He was a fairly humane man
toward slaves and other animals; he was an exceedingly humane man toward
the erring of his own race.",mark
"Theft he could not abide, and plainly there
was a thief in his house.",mark
"Necessarily the thief must be one of his
negroes.",mark
Sharp measures must be taken.,mark
"He called his servants before
him.",mark
"There were three of these, besides Roxy: a man, a woman, and a boy
twelve years old.",mark
They were not related.,mark
"Mr. Driscoll said:

""You have all been warned before.",mark
It has done no good.,mark
"This time I will
teach you a lesson.",mark
I will sell the thief.,mark
"Which of you is the guilty
one?""",mark
"They all shuddered at the threat, for here they had a good home, and a
new one was likely to be a change for the worse.",mark
The denial was general.,mark
"None had stolen anything--not money, anyway--a little sugar, or cake, or
honey, or something like that, that ""Marse Percy wouldn't mind or miss,""
but not money--never a cent of money.",mark
"They were eloquent in their
protestations, but Mr. Driscoll was not moved by them.",mark
"He answered each
in turn with a stern ""Name the thief!""",mark
"The truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; she suspected that the others
were guilty, but she did not know them to be so.",mark
"She was horrified to
think how near she had come to being guilty herself; she had been saved
in the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church, a
fortnight before, at which time and place she ""got religion.""",mark
"The very
next day after that gracious experience, while her change of style was
fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition, her master
left a couple dollars lying unprotected on his desk, and she happened
upon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dust-rag.",mark
"She
looked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment, then she
burst out with--

""Dad blame dat revival, I wisht it had 'a' be'n put off till to-morrow!""",mark

champagne are entered as having been consumed.",oscar

"Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.",oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
"Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
drink the champagne?",oscar
I ask merely for information.,oscar
LANE.,oscar
"I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.",oscar
"I have often
observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
first-rate brand.",oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
Good heavens!,oscar
Is marriage so demoralising as that?,oscar
LANE.,oscar
"I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir.",oscar
"I have had very little
experience of it myself up to the present.",oscar
"I have only been married
once.",oscar

a young person.",oscar

ALGERNON.,oscar
"Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite
approve of your being here.",oscar
JACK.,oscar
May I ask why?,oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
"My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly
disgraceful.",oscar
It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.,oscar
JACK.,oscar
I am in love with Gwendolen.,oscar

propose to her.",oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
I thought you had come up for pleasure?,oscar
.,oscar
.,oscar
.,oscar
I call that business.,oscar
JACK.,oscar
How utterly unromantic you are!,oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing.,oscar

to be in love.",oscar
But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.,oscar

ever I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.",oscar

Gwendolen.",oscar
Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.,oscar

butter it is too.",oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
"Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it
all.",oscar
You behave as if you were married to her already.,oscar
"You are not
married to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.",oscar
JACK.,oscar
Why on earth do you say that?,oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
"Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.",oscar
Girls don’t think it right.,oscar
JACK.,oscar
"Oh, that is nonsense!",oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
It isn’t.,oscar
It is a great truth.,oscar
"It accounts for the extraordinary number
of bachelors that one sees all over the place.",oscar
"In the second place, I
don’t give my consent.",oscar
JACK.,oscar
Your consent!,oscar
ALGERNON.,oscar
"My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.",oscar
"And before I allow you to
marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.",oscar

Cecily!,oscar
What on earth do you mean?,oscar

don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.",oscar

"﻿CHAPTER I

[3] The studio was filled with the rich odor of roses, and when the
light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came
through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more
delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.",oscar
"From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was
lying, smoking, as usual, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton
could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-colored
blossoms of the laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able
to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and
then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
those pallid jade-faced painters who, in an art that is necessarily
immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.",oscar
"The sullen
murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass,
or circling with monotonous insistence round the black-crocketed spires
of the early June hollyhocks, seemed to make the stillness more
oppressive, and the dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a
distant organ.",oscar
"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the
full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,
and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist
himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago
caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many
strange conjectures.",oscar
"As he looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully
mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and
seemed about to linger there.",oscar
"But he suddenly started up, and, closing
[4] his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to
imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he
might awake.",oscar
"""It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"" said
Lord Henry, languidly.",oscar
"""You must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor.",oscar
The Academy is too large and too vulgar.,oscar
"The Grosvenor is
the only place.""",oscar
"""I don't think I will send it anywhere,"" he answered, tossing his head
back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at
Oxford.",oscar
"""No: I won't send it anywhere.""",oscar
"Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement
through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful
whorls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette.",oscar
"""Not send it anywhere?",oscar
"My dear fellow, why?",oscar
Have you any reason?,oscar
"What odd chaps you painters
are!",oscar
You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.,oscar
"As soon as you
have one, you seem to want to throw it away.",oscar
"It is silly of you, for
there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and
that is not being talked about.",oscar
"A portrait like this would set you far
above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous,
if old men are ever capable of any emotion.""",oscar
"""I know you will laugh at me,"" he replied, ""but I really can't exhibit
it.",oscar
"I have put too much of myself into it.""",oscar
"Lord Henry stretched his long legs out on the divan and shook with
laughter.",oscar
"""Yes, I knew you would laugh; but it is quite true, all the same.""",oscar
"""Too much of yourself in it!",oscar
"Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you
were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with
your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young
Adonis, who looks as if he was made of ivory and rose-leaves.",oscar
"Why, my
dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an
intellectual expression, and all that.",oscar
"But beauty, real beauty, ends
where an intellectual expression begins.",oscar
"Intellect is in itself an
exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.",oscar
"The moment one
sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something
horrid.",oscar
Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.,oscar
How perfectly hideous they are!,oscar
"Except, of course, in the Church.",oscar
"But
then in the Church they don't think.",oscar
"A bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,
and consequently he always looks absolutely delightful.",oscar
"Your
mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose
picture really fascinates me, never thinks.",oscar
I feel quite sure of that.,oscar
"He is a brainless, beautiful thing, who should be always here in winter
when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we
want something to chill our intelligence.",oscar
"Don't flatter yourself,
Basil: you are not in the least like him.""",oscar
"""You don't understand me, Harry.",oscar
Of course I am not like him.,oscar
"I know
that perfectly well.",oscar
"Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him.",oscar
"You
shrug your shoulders?",oscar
I am telling you the truth.,oscar
"There is a fatality
about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality
that [5] seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.",oscar
"It
is better not to be different from one's fellows.",oscar
"The ugly and the
stupid have the best of it in this world.",oscar
"They can sit quietly and
gape at the play.",oscar
"If they know nothing of victory, they are at least
spared the knowledge of defeat.",oscar
"They live as we all should live,
undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.",oscar
"They neither bring ruin
upon others nor ever receive it from alien hands.",oscar
"Your rank and
wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are,--my fame, whatever it may
be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks,--we will all suffer for what the
gods have given us, suffer terribly.""",oscar
"""Dorian Gray?",oscar
"is that his name?""",oscar
"said Lord Henry, walking across the
studio towards Basil Hallward.",oscar
"""Yes; that is his name.",oscar
"I didn't intend to tell it to you.""",oscar
"""But why not?""",oscar
"""Oh, I can't explain.",oscar
"When I like people immensely I never tell their
names to any one.",oscar
It seems like surrendering a part of them.,oscar
"You know
how I love secrecy.",oscar
"It is the only thing that can make modern life
wonderful or mysterious to us.",oscar
"The commonest thing is delightful if
one only hides it.",oscar
"When I leave town I never tell my people where I am
going.",oscar
"If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.",oscar
"It is a silly habit, I
dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into
one's life.",oscar
"I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?""",oscar
"""Not at all,"" answered Lord Henry, laying his hand upon his shoulder;
""not at all, my dear Basil.",oscar
"You seem to forget that I am married, and
the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception
necessary for both parties.",oscar
"I never know where my wife is, and my wife
never knows what I am doing.",oscar
"When we meet,--we do meet occasionally,
when we dine out together, or go down to the duke's,--we tell each
other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.",oscar
"My wife is
very good at it,--much better, in fact, than I am.",oscar
"She never gets
confused over her dates, and I always do.",oscar
"But when she does find me
out, she makes no row at all.",oscar
"I sometimes wish she would; but she
merely laughs at me.""",oscar
"""I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,"" said Basil
Hallward, shaking his hand off, and strolling towards the door that led
into the garden.",oscar
"""I believe that you are really a very good husband,
but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.",oscar
"You are an
extraordinary fellow.",oscar
"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a
wrong thing.",oscar
"Your cynicism is simply a pose.""",oscar
"""Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,""
cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the
garden together, and for a time they did not speak.",oscar
After a long pause Lord Henry pulled out his watch.,oscar
"""I am afraid I
must be going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go I insist on your
answering a question I put to you some time ago.""",oscar
"""What is that?""",oscar
"asked Basil Hallward, keeping his eyes fixed on the
ground.",oscar
"""You know quite well.""",oscar
"""I do not, Harry.""",oscar
"[6] ""Well, I will tell you what it is.""",oscar
"""Please don't.""",oscar
"""I must.",oscar
"I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian
Gray's picture.",oscar
"I want the real reason.""",oscar
"""I told you the real reason.""",oscar
"""No, you did not.",oscar
"You said it was because there was too much of
yourself in it.",oscar
"Now, that is childish.""",oscar
"""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every
portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not
of the sitter.",oscar
"The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.",oscar
"It is
not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on
the colored canvas, reveals himself.",oscar
"The reason I will not exhibit
this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown with it the secret
of my own soul.""",oscar
Lord Harry laughed.,oscar
"""And what is that?""",oscar
he asked.,oscar
"""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; and an expression of perplexity came
over his face.",oscar
"""I am all expectation, Basil,"" murmured his companion, looking at him.",oscar
"""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the young
painter; ""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.",oscar
"Perhaps you
will hardly believe it.""",oscar
"Lord Henry smiled, and, leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy
from the grass, and examined it.",oscar
"""I am quite sure I shall understand
it,"" he replied, gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered
disk, ""and I can believe anything, provided that it is incredible.""",oscar
"The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac
blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid
air.",oscar
"A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass, and a long thin
dragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings.",oscar
"Lord Henry felt as if
he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and he wondered what was
coming.",oscar
"""Well, this is incredible,"" repeated Hallward, rather
bitterly,--""incredible to me at times.",oscar
I don't know what it means.,oscar
The story is simply this.,oscar
"Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady
Brandon's.",oscar
"You know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society
from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.",oscar
"With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody,
even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.",oscar
"Well,
after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge
overdressed dowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became
conscious that some one was looking at me.",oscar
"I turned half-way round,
and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.",oscar
"When our eyes met, I felt that
I was growing pale.",oscar
A curious instinct of terror came over me.,oscar
"I knew
that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was
so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole
nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.",oscar
"I did not want any external
influence in my life.",oscar
"You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am
by nature.",oscar
My father destined me for the army.,oscar
"I insisted on [7]
going to Oxford.",oscar
Then he made me enter my name at the Middle Temple.,oscar
"Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar, and
announced my intention of becoming a painter.",oscar
"I have always been my
own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.",oscar
Then--But I don't know how to explain it to you.,oscar
"Something seemed to
tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.",oscar
"I had
a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and
exquisite sorrows.",oscar
"I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become
absolutely devoted to him, and that I ought not to speak to him.",oscar
"I
grew afraid, and turned to quit the room.",oscar
"It was not conscience that
made me do so: it was cowardice.",oscar
"I take no credit to myself for trying
to escape.""",oscar
"""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.",oscar
"Conscience
is the trade-name of the firm.",oscar
"That is all.""",oscar
"""I don't believe that, Harry.",oscar
"However, whatever was my motive,--and it
may have been pride, for I used to be very proud,--I certainly
struggled to the door.",oscar
"There, of course, I stumbled against Lady
Brandon.",oscar
"'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr.",oscar
Hallward?',oscar
"she
screamed out.",oscar
"You know her shrill horrid voice?""",oscar
"""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry,
pulling the daisy to bits with his long, nervous fingers.",oscar
"""I could not get rid of her.",oscar
"She brought me up to Royalties, and
people with Stars and Garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras
and hooked noses.",oscar
She spoke of me as her dearest friend.,oscar
"I had only
met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.",oscar
"I

that.",oscar

destined to know each other.""",oscar

"I know
she goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests.",oscar
"I remember
her bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman
covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a
tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in
the room, something like 'Sir Humpty Dumpty--you know--Afghan
frontier--Russian intrigues: very successful man--wife killed by an
elephant--quite inconsolable--wants to marry a beautiful American
widow--everybody does nowadays--hates Mr. Gladstone--but very much
interested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of Schouvaloff.'",oscar

simply fled.",oscar

﻿Mrs.,virginia
Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.,virginia
For Lucy had her work cut out for her.,virginia
"The doors would be taken off
their hinges; Rumpelmayer’s men were coming.",virginia
"And then, thought Clarissa
Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on a beach.",virginia
What a lark!,virginia
What a plunge!,virginia
"For so it had always seemed to her, when,
with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had
burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air.",virginia
"How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the
early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and
sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling
as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was
about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke
winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking
until Peter Walsh said, “Musing among the vegetables?”--was that
it?--“I prefer men to cauliflowers”--was that it?",virginia
"He must have said it
at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace--Peter
Walsh.",virginia
"He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she
forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one
remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and,
when millions of things had utterly vanished--how strange it was!--a
few sayings like this about cabbages.",virginia
"She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall’s van to
pass.",virginia
"A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one
does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of
the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though
she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness.",virginia
"There she
perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.",virginia
For having lived in Westminster--how many years now?,virginia
"over twenty,--one
feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa
was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable
pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said,
by influenza) before Big Ben strikes.",virginia
There!,virginia
Out it boomed.,virginia
"First
a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable.",virginia
"The leaden circles
dissolved in the air.",virginia
"Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria
Street.",virginia
"For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so,
making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every
moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries
sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can’t be dealt
with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason:
they love life.",virginia
"In people’s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in
the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans,
sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the
triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane
overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.",virginia
For it was the middle of June.,virginia
"The War was over, except for some one
like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out
because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go
to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with
the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was
over; thank Heaven--over.",virginia
It was June.,virginia
"The King and Queen were at
the Palace.",virginia
"And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was
a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats;
Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh
of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind
them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies,
whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling
young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even
now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for
a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting
out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers
were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their
lovely old sea-green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to
tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for
Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and
faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers
once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to
kindle and illuminate; to give her party.",virginia
"But how strange, on entering
the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy
ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with
his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying
a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her
old friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!",virginia
"“Good-morning to you, Clarissa!” said Hugh, rather extravagantly, for
they had known each other as children.",virginia
"“Where are you off to?”

“I love walking in London,” said Mrs. Dalloway.",virginia
"“Really it’s better
than walking in the country.”

They had just come up--unfortunately--to see doctors.",virginia
"Other people
came to see pictures; go to the opera; take their daughters out; the
Whitbreads came “to see doctors.” Times without number Clarissa had
visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home.",virginia
Was Evelyn ill again?,virginia
"Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind
of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome,
perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always,
but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife
had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend,
Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to
specify.",virginia
"Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very
sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat.",virginia
"Not the
right hat for the early morning, was that it?",virginia
"For Hugh always made
her feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and
assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he
was coming to her party to-night, Evelyn absolutely insisted, only a
little late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had
to take one of Jim’s boys,--she always felt a little skimpy beside
Hugh; schoolgirlish; but attached to him, partly from having known
him always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though
Richard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had
never to this day forgiven her for liking him.",virginia
"She could remember scene after scene at Bourton--Peter furious;
Hugh not, of course, his match in any way, but still not a positive
imbecile as Peter made out; not a mere barber’s block.",virginia
"When his old
mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did
it, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as
Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners
and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at
his worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be impossible; but
adorable to walk with on a morning like this.",virginia
(June had drawn out every leaf on the trees.,virginia
"The mothers of Pimlico
gave suck to their young.",virginia
"Messages were passing from the Fleet to the
Admiralty.",virginia
"Arlington Street and Piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air
in the Park and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, on waves of that
divine vitality which Clarissa loved.",virginia
"To dance, to ride, she had adored
all that.)",virginia
"For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter; she
never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks; but suddenly it would
come over her, If he were with me now what would he say?--some
days, some sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the
old bitterness; which perhaps was the reward of having cared for
people; they came back in the middle of St. James’s Park on a fine
morning--indeed they did.",virginia
"But Peter--however beautiful the day might
be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink--Peter
never saw a thing of all that.",virginia
"He would put on his spectacles, if
she told him to; he would look.",virginia
"It was the state of the world that
interested him; Wagner, Pope’s poetry, people’s characters eternally,
and the defects of her own soul.",virginia
How he scolded her!,virginia
How they argued!,virginia
"She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase;
the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her
bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.",virginia
"So she would still find herself arguing in St. James’s Park, still
making out that she had been right--and she had too--not to marry him.",virginia
"For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be
between people living together day in day out in the same house; which
Richard gave her, and she him.",virginia
(Where was he this morning for instance?,virginia
"Some committee, she never asked what.)",virginia
"But with Peter everything had
to be shared; everything gone into.",virginia
"And it was intolerable, and when
it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain, she had to
break with him or they would have been destroyed, both of them ruined,
she was convinced; though she had borne about with her for years like
an arrow sticking in her heart the grief, the anguish; and then the
horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had
married a woman met on the boat going to India!",virginia
"Never should she forget
all that!",virginia
"Cold, heartless, a prude, he called her.",virginia
"Never could she
understand how he cared.",virginia
"But those Indian women did presumably--silly,
pretty, flimsy nincompoops.",virginia
And she wasted her pity.,virginia
"For he was quite
happy, he assured her--perfectly happy, though he had never done a
thing that they talked of; his whole life had been a failure.",virginia
"It made
her angry still.",virginia
She had reached the Park gates.,virginia
"She stood for a moment, looking at the
omnibuses in Piccadilly.",virginia
"She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or
were that.",virginia
She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged.,virginia
"She
sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside,
looking on.",virginia
"She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of
being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling
that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.",virginia
"Not that she
thought herself clever, or much out of the ordinary.",virginia
"How she had got
through life on the few twigs of knowledge Fräulein Daniels gave them
she could not think.",virginia
"She knew nothing; no language, no history; she
scarcely read a book now, except memoirs in bed; and yet to her it was
absolutely absorbing; all this; the cabs passing; and she would not say
of Peter, she would not say of herself, I am this, I am that.",virginia
"Her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct, she thought,
walking on.",virginia
"If you put her in a room with some one, up went her back
like a cat’s; or she purred.",virginia
"Devonshire House, Bath House, the house
with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and
remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton--such hosts of people; and dancing
all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and driving home
across the Park.",virginia
"She remembered once throwing a shilling into the
Serpentine.",virginia
"But every one remembered; what she loved was this, here,
now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab.",virginia
"Did it matter then, she
asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it matter that she must
inevitably cease completely; all this must go on without her; did she
resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended
absolutely?",virginia
"but that somehow in the streets of London, on the ebb and
flow of things, here, there, she survived, Peter survived, lived in
each other, she being part, she was positive, of the trees at home;
of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was;
part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between
the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had
seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life,
herself.",virginia
"But what was she dreaming as she looked into Hatchards’ shop
window?",virginia
What was she trying to recover?,virginia
"What image of white dawn in the
country, as she read in the book spread open:

    Fear no more the heat o’ the sun
      Nor the furious winter’s rages.",virginia
"This late age of the world’s experience had bred in them all, all men
and women, a well of tears.",virginia
"Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance; a
perfectly upright and stoical bearing.",virginia
"Think, for example, of the woman
she admired most, Lady Bexborough, opening the bazaar.",virginia
"There were Jorrocks’ _Jaunts and Jollities_; there were _Soapy Sponge_
and Mrs. Asquith’s _Memoirs_ and _Big Game Shooting in Nigeria_, all
spread open.",virginia
"Ever so many books there were; but none that seemed
exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home.",virginia
"Nothing
that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried-up
little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment cordial;
before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women’s
ailments.",virginia
"How much she wanted it--that people should look pleased
as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards
Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have other reasons for
doing things.",virginia
"Much rather would she have been one of those people like
Richard who did things for themselves, whereas, she thought, waiting
to cross, half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves;
but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew (and
now the policeman held up his hand) for no one was ever for a second
taken in.",virginia
Oh if she could have had her life over again!,virginia
"she thought,
stepping on to the pavement, could have looked even differently!",virginia
"She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady Bexborough,
with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes.",virginia
"She would have
been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather large; interested
in politics like a man; with a country house; very dignified, very
sincere.",virginia
"Instead of which she had a narrow pea-stick figure; a
ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird’s.",virginia
"That she held herself
well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and dressed well,
considering that she spent little.",virginia
"But often now this body she wore
(she stopped to look at a Dutch picture), this body, with all its
capacities, seemed nothing--nothing at all.",virginia
"She had the oddest sense of
being herself invisible; unseen; unknown; there being no more marrying,
no more having of children now, but only this astonishing and rather
solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs.
Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway.",virginia
"Bond Street fascinated her; Bond Street early in the morning in the
season; its flags flying; its shops; no splash; no glitter; one roll
of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty
years; a few pearls; salmon on an iceblock.",virginia
"“That is all,” she said, looking at the fishmonger’s.",virginia
"“That is all,”
she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where,
before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves.",virginia
"And her old Uncle
William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves.",virginia
"He had
turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the War.",virginia
"He had said, “I
have had enough.” Gloves and shoes; she had a passion for gloves; but
her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a straw for either of them.",virginia
"Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where they
kept flowers for her when she gave a party.",virginia
"Elizabeth really cared for
her dog most of all.",virginia
The whole house this morning smelt of tar.,virginia
"Still,
better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman; better distemper and tar and all
the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer
book!",virginia
"Better anything, she was inclined to say.",virginia
"But it might be only
a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through.",virginia
"It might be
falling in love.",virginia
But why with Miss Kilman?,virginia
"who had been badly treated
of course; one must make allowances for that, and Richard said she was
very able, had a really historical mind.",virginia
"Anyhow they were inseparable,
and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to Communion; and how she
dressed, how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a
bit, it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people
callous (so did causes); dulled their feelings, for Miss Kilman would
do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians, but
in private inflicted positive torture, so insensitive was she, dressed
in a green mackintosh coat.",virginia
"Year in year out she wore that coat; she
perspired; she was never in the room five minutes without making you
feel her superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you
were; how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or
whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking
in it, her dismissal from school during the War--poor embittered
unfortunate creature!",virginia
"For it was not her one hated but the idea of her,
which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not
Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in
the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half
our life-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw
of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would
have loved Miss Kilman!",virginia
But not in this world.,virginia
No.,virginia
"It rasped her, though, to have stirring about in her this brutal
monster!",virginia
"to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the
depths of that leaf-encumbered forest, the soul; never to be content
quite, or quite secure, for at any moment the brute would be stirring,
this hatred, which, especially since her illness, had power to make
her feel scraped, hurt in her spine; gave her physical pain, and made
all pleasure in beauty, in friendship, in being well, in being loved
and making her home delightful rock, quiver, and bend as if indeed
there were a monster grubbing at the roots, as if the whole panoply of
content were nothing but self love!",virginia
this hatred!,virginia
"Nonsense, nonsense!",virginia
"she cried to herself, pushing through the swing
doors of Mulberry’s the florists.",virginia
"She advanced, light, tall, very upright, to be greeted at once by
button-faced Miss Pym, whose hands were always bright red, as if they
had been stood in cold water with the flowers.",virginia
"There were flowers: delphiniums, sweet peas, bunches of lilac; and
carnations, masses of carnations.",virginia
There were roses; there were irises.,virginia
"Ah yes--so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood
talking to Miss Pym who owed her help, and thought her kind, for
kind she had been years ago; very kind, but she looked older, this
year, turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses
and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed, snuffing in,
after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the exquisite coolness.",virginia
"And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like frilled linen clean from
a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked; and dark and prim
the red carnations, holding their heads up; and all the sweet peas
spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale--as if it
were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas
and roses after the superb summer’s day, with its almost blue-black
sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its arum lilies was over; and
it was the moment between six and seven when every flower--roses,
carnations, irises, lilac--glows; white, violet, red, deep orange;
every flower seems to burn by itself, softly, purely in the misty beds;
and how she loved the grey-white moths spinning in and out, over the
cherry pie, over the evening primroses!",virginia
"And as she began to go with Miss Pym from jar to jar, choosing,
nonsense, nonsense, she said to herself, more and more gently, as if
this beauty, this scent, this colour, and Miss Pym liking her, trusting
her, were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred,
that monster, surmount it all; and it lifted her up and up when--oh!",virginia
"a
pistol shot in the street outside!",virginia
"“Dear, those motor cars,” said Miss Pym, going to the window to look,
and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet
peas, as if those motor cars, those tyres of motor cars, were all _her_
fault.",virginia
"*       *       *       *       *

The violent explosion which made Mrs. Dalloway jump and Miss Pym go
to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to
the side of the pavement precisely opposite Mulberry’s shop window.",virginia
"Passers-by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time to see a
face of the very greatest importance against the dove-grey upholstery,
before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen
except a square of dove grey.",virginia
"Yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of Bond Street
to Oxford Street on one side, to Atkinson’s scent shop on the other,
passing invisibly, inaudibly, like a cloud, swift, veil-like upon
hills, falling indeed with something of a cloud’s sudden sobriety and
stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly.",virginia
"But now mystery had brushed them with her wing; they had heard the
voice of authority; the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes
bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide.",virginia
"But nobody knew whose face
had been seen.",virginia
"Was it the Prince of Wales’s, the Queen’s, the Prime
Minister’s?",virginia
Whose face was it?,virginia
Nobody knew.,virginia
"Edgar J. Watkiss, with his roll of lead piping round his arm, said
audibly, humorously of course: “The Proime Minister’s kyar.”

Septimus Warren Smith, who found himself unable to pass, heard him.",virginia
"Septimus Warren Smith, aged about thirty, pale-faced, beak-nosed,
wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat, with hazel eyes which had
that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers
apprehensive too.",virginia
The world has raised its whip; where will it descend?,virginia
Everything had come to a standstill.,virginia
"The throb of the motor engines
sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body.",virginia
"The
sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped
outside Mulberry’s shop window; old ladies on the tops of omnibuses
spread their black parasols; here a green, here a red parasol opened
with a little pop.",virginia
"Mrs. Dalloway, coming to the window with her arms
full of sweet peas, looked out with her little pink face pursed in
enquiry.",virginia
Every one looked at the motor car.,virginia
Septimus looked.,virginia
"Boys on
bicycles sprang off.",virginia
Traffic accumulated.,virginia
"And there the motor car
stood, with drawn blinds, and upon them a curious pattern like a tree,
Septimus thought, and this gradual drawing together of everything to
one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the
surface and was about to burst into flames, terrified him.",virginia
"The world
wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames.",virginia
"It is I who
am blocking the way, he thought.",virginia
"Was he not being looked at and pointed
at; was he not weighted there, rooted to the pavement, for a purpose?",virginia
But for what purpose?,virginia
"“Let us go on, Septimus,” said his wife, a little woman, with large
eyes in a sallow pointed face; an Italian girl.",virginia
"But Lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and the
tree pattern on the blinds.",virginia
"Was it the Queen in there--the Queen going
shopping?",virginia
"The chauffeur, who had been opening something, turning something,
shutting something, got on to the box.",virginia
"“Come on,” said Lucrezia.",virginia
"But her husband, for they had been married four, five years now,
jumped, started, and said, “All right!” angrily, as if she had
interrupted him.",virginia
People must notice; people must see.,virginia
"People, she thought, looking at
the crowd staring at the motor car; the English people, with their
children and their horses and their clothes, which she admired in a
way; but they were “people” now, because Septimus had said, “I will
kill myself”; an awful thing to say.",virginia
Suppose they had heard him?,virginia
"She
looked at the crowd.",virginia
"Help, help!",virginia
"she wanted to cry out to butchers’
boys and women.",virginia
Help!,virginia
"Only last autumn she and Septimus had stood on
the Embankment wrapped in the same cloak and, Septimus reading a paper
instead of talking, she had snatched it from him and laughed in the old
man’s face who saw them!",virginia
But failure one conceals.,virginia
"She must take him
away into some park.",virginia
"“Now we will cross,” she said.",virginia
"She had a right to his arm, though it was without feeling.",virginia
"He would
give her, who was so simple, so impulsive, only twenty-four, without
friends in England, who had left Italy for his sake, a piece of bone.",virginia
"The motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable reserve
proceeded towards Piccadilly, still gazed at, still ruffling the faces
on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of veneration
whether for Queen, Prince, or Prime Minister nobody knew.",virginia
"The face
itself had been seen only once by three people for a few seconds.",virginia
Even the sex was now in dispute.,virginia
"But there could be no doubt that
greatness was seated within; greatness was passing, hidden, down Bond
Street, removed only by a hand’s-breadth from ordinary people who might
now, for the first and last time, be within speaking distance of the
majesty of England, of the enduring symbol of the state which will be
known to curious antiquaries, sifting the ruins of time, when London
is a grass-grown path and all those hurrying along the pavement this
Wednesday morning are but bones with a few wedding rings mixed up in
their dust and the gold stoppings of innumerable decayed teeth.",virginia
"The
face in the motor car will then be known.",virginia
"It is probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway, coming out of
Mulberry’s with her flowers; the Queen.",virginia
"And for a second she wore a
look of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight
while the car passed at a foot’s pace, with its blinds drawn.",virginia
"The Queen
going to some hospital; the Queen opening some bazaar, thought Clarissa.",virginia
The crush was terrific for the time of day.,virginia
"Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham,
what was it?",virginia
"she wondered, for the street was blocked.",virginia
"The British
middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses with parcels
and umbrellas, yes, even furs on a day like this, were, she thought,
more ridiculous, more unlike anything there has ever been than one
could conceive; and the Queen herself held up; the Queen herself unable
to pass.",virginia
"Clarissa was suspended on one side of Brook Street; Sir John
Buckhurst, the old Judge on the other, with the car between them (Sir
John had laid down the law for years and liked a well-dressed woman)
when the chauffeur, leaning ever so slightly, said or showed something
to the policeman, who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head
and moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through.",virginia
"Slowly
and very silently it took its way.",virginia
"Clarissa guessed; Clarissa knew of course; she had seen something
white, magical, circular, in the footman’s hand, a disc inscribed
with a name,--the Queen’s, the Prince of Wales’s, the Prime
Minister’s?--which, by force of its own lustre, burnt its way through
(Clarissa saw the car diminishing, disappearing), to blaze among
candelabras, glittering stars, breasts stiff with oak leaves, Hugh
Whitbread and all his colleagues, the gentlemen of England, that night
in Buckingham Palace.",virginia
"And Clarissa, too, gave a party.",virginia
"She stiffened a
little; so she would stand at the top of her stairs.",virginia
"The car had gone, but it had left a slight ripple which flowed through
glove shops and hat shops and tailors’ shops on both sides of Bond
Street.",virginia
"For thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way--to the
window.",virginia
"Choosing a pair of gloves--should they be to the elbow or above
it, lemon or pale grey?--ladies stopped; when the sentence was finished
something had happened.",virginia
"Something so trifling in single instances that
no mathematical instrument, though capable of transmitting shocks
in China, could register the vibration; yet in its fulness rather
formidable and in its common appeal emotional; for in all the hat shops
and tailors’ shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the
dead; of the flag; of Empire.",virginia
"In a public house in a back street a
Colonial insulted the House of Windsor which led to words, broken beer
glasses, and a general shindy, which echoed strangely across the way
in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white
ribbon for their weddings.",virginia
"For the surface agitation of the passing car
as it sunk grazed something very profound.",virginia
"Gliding across Piccadilly, the car turned down St. James’s Street.",virginia
"﻿CHAPTER I


It was a Sunday evening in October, and in common with many other young
ladies of her class, Katharine Hilbery was pouring out tea.",virginia
"Perhaps a
fifth part of her mind was thus occupied, and the remaining parts leapt
over the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning
and this rather subdued moment, and played with the things one does
voluntarily and normally in the daylight.",virginia
"But although she was silent,
she was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to
her, and inclined to let it take its way for the six hundredth time,
perhaps, without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties.",virginia
"A
single glance was enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the
gifts which make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people
successful, that she scarcely needed any help from her daughter,
provided that the tiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was
discharged for her.",virginia
"Considering that the little party had been seated round the tea-table
for less than twenty minutes, the animation observable on their faces,
and the amount of sound they were producing collectively, were very
creditable to the hostess.",virginia
"It suddenly came into Katharine’s mind that
if some one opened the door at this moment he would think that they
were enjoying themselves; he would think, “What an extremely nice house
to come into!” and instinctively she laughed, and said something to
increase the noise, for the credit of the house presumably, since she
herself had not been feeling exhilarated.",virginia
"At the very same moment,
rather to her amusement, the door was flung open, and a young man
entered the room.",virginia
"Katharine, as she shook hands with him, asked him, in
her own mind, “Now, do you think we’re enjoying ourselves
enormously?”... “Mr.",virginia
"Denham, mother,” she said aloud, for she saw that
her mother had forgotten his name.",virginia
"That fact was perceptible to Mr. Denham also, and increased the
awkwardness which inevitably attends the entrance of a stranger into a
room full of people much at their ease, and all launched upon
sentences.",virginia
"At the same time, it seemed to Mr. Denham as if a thousand
softly padded doors had closed between him and the street outside.",virginia
"A
fine mist, the etherealized essence of the fog, hung visibly in the
wide and rather empty space of the drawing-room, all silver where the
candles were grouped on the tea-table, and ruddy again in the
firelight.",virginia
"With the omnibuses and cabs still running in his head, and
his body still tingling with his quick walk along the streets and in
and out of traffic and foot-passengers, this drawing-room seemed very
remote and still; and the faces of the elderly people were mellowed, at
some distance from each other, and had a bloom on them owing to the
fact that the air in the drawing-room was thickened by blue grains of
mist.",virginia
"Mr. Denham had come in as Mr. Fortescue, the eminent novelist,
reached the middle of a very long sentence.",virginia
"He kept this suspended
while the newcomer sat down, and Mrs. Hilbery deftly joined the severed
parts by leaning towards him and remarking:

“Now, what would you do if you were married to an engineer, and had to
live in Manchester, Mr. Denham?”

“Surely she could learn Persian,” broke in a thin, elderly gentleman.",virginia
"“Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with
whom she could read Persian?”

“A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester,”
Katharine explained.",virginia
"Mr. Denham muttered something, which was indeed
all that was required of him, and the novelist went on where he had
left off.",virginia
"Privately, Mr. Denham cursed himself very sharply for having
exchanged the freedom of the street for this sophisticated
drawing-room, where, among other disagreeables, he certainly would not
appear at his best.",virginia
"He glanced round him, and saw that, save for
Katharine, they were all over forty, the only consolation being that
Mr. Fortescue was a considerable celebrity, so that to-morrow one might
be glad to have met him.",virginia
“Have you ever been to Manchester?” he asked Katharine.,virginia
"“Never,” she replied.",virginia
"“Why do you object to it, then?”

Katharine stirred her tea, and seemed to speculate, so Denham thought,
upon the duty of filling somebody else’s cup, but she was really
wondering how she was going to keep this strange young man in harmony
with the rest.",virginia
"She observed that he was compressing his teacup, so that
there was danger lest the thin china might cave inwards.",virginia
"She could see
that he was nervous; one would expect a bony young man with his face
slightly reddened by the wind, and his hair not altogether smooth, to
be nervous in such a party.",virginia
"Further, he probably disliked this kind of
thing, and had come out of curiosity, or because her father had invited
him—anyhow, he would not be easily combined with the rest.",virginia
"“I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester,” she
replied at random.",virginia
"Mr. Fortescue had been observing her for a moment or
two, as novelists are inclined to observe, and at this remark he
smiled, and made it the text for a little further speculation.",virginia
"“In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration, Katharine decidedly
hits the mark,” he said, and lying back in his chair, with his opaque
contemplative eyes fixed on the ceiling, and the tips of his fingers
pressed together, he depicted, first the horrors of the streets of
Manchester, and then the bare, immense moors on the outskirts of the
town, and then the scrubby little house in which the girl would live,
and then the professors and the miserable young students devoted to the
more strenuous works of our younger dramatists, who would visit her,
and how her appearance would change by degrees, and how she would fly
to London, and how Katharine would have to lead her about, as one leads
an eager dog on a chain, past rows of clamorous butchers’ shops, poor
dear creature.",virginia
"“Oh, Mr. Fortescue,” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery, as he finished, “I had
just written to say how I envied her!",virginia
"I was thinking of the big gardens
and the dear old ladies in mittens, who read nothing but the
“Spectator,” and snuff the candles.",virginia
Have they _all_ disappeared?,virginia
"I told
her she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets
that depress one so.”

“There is the University,” said the thin gentleman, who had previously
insisted upon the existence of people knowing Persian.",virginia
"“I know there are moors there, because I read about them in a book the
other day,” said Katharine.",virginia
"“I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family,” Mr. Hilbery
remarked.",virginia
"He was an elderly man, with a pair of oval, hazel eyes which
were rather bright for his time of life, and relieved the heaviness of
his face.",virginia
"He played constantly with a little green stone attached to
his watch-chain, thus displaying long and very sensitive fingers, and
had a habit of moving his head hither and thither very quickly without
altering the position of his large and rather corpulent body, so that
he seemed to be providing himself incessantly with food for amusement
and reflection with the least possible expenditure of energy.",virginia
"One might
suppose that he had passed the time of life when his ambitions were
personal, or that he had gratified them as far as he was likely to do,
and now employed his considerable acuteness rather to observe and
reflect than to attain any result.",virginia
"Katharine, so Denham decided, while Mr. Fortescue built up another
rounded structure of words, had a likeness to each of her parents, but
these elements were rather oddly blended.",virginia
"She had the quick, impulsive
movements of her mother, the lips parting often to speak, and closing
again; and the dark oval eyes of her father brimming with light upon a
basis of sadness, or, since she was too young to have acquired a
sorrowful point of view, one might say that the basis was not sadness
so much as a spirit given to contemplation and self-control.",virginia
"Judging by
her hair, her coloring, and the shape of her features, she was
striking, if not actually beautiful.",virginia
"Decision and composure stamped
her, a combination of qualities that produced a very marked character,
and one that was not calculated to put a young man, who scarcely knew
her, at his ease.",virginia
"For the rest, she was tall; her dress was of some
quiet color, with old yellow-tinted lace for ornament, to which the
spark of an ancient jewel gave its one red gleam.",virginia
"Denham noticed that,
although silent, she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer
immediately her mother appealed to her for help, and yet it was obvious
to him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind.",virginia
"It
struck him that her position at the tea-table, among all these elderly
people, was not without its difficulties, and he checked his
inclination to find her, or her attitude, generally antipathetic to
him.",virginia
"The talk had passed over Manchester, after dealing with it very
generously.",virginia
"“Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada, Katharine?”
her mother demanded.",virginia
"“Trafalgar, mother.”

“Trafalgar, of course!",virginia
How stupid of me!,virginia
"Another cup of tea, with a
thin slice of lemon in it, and then, dear Mr. Fortescue, please explain
my absurd little puzzle.",virginia
"One can’t help believing gentlemen with Roman
noses, even if one meets them in omnibuses.”

Mr. Hilbery here interposed so far as Denham was concerned, and talked
a great deal of sense about the solicitors’ profession, and the changes
which he had seen in his lifetime.",virginia
"Indeed, Denham properly fell to his
lot, owing to the fact that an article by Denham upon some legal
matter, published by Mr. Hilbery in his Review, had brought them
acquainted.",virginia
"But when a moment later Mrs. Sutton Bailey was announced,
he turned to her, and Mr. Denham found himself sitting silent,
rejecting possible things to say, beside Katharine, who was silent too.",virginia
"Being much about the same age and both under thirty, they were
prohibited from the use of a great many convenient phrases which launch
conversation into smooth waters.",virginia
"They were further silenced by
Katharine’s rather malicious determination not to help this young man,
in whose upright and resolute bearing she detected something hostile to
her surroundings, by any of the usual feminine amenities.",virginia
"They
therefore sat silent, Denham controlling his desire to say something
abrupt and explosive, which should shock her into life.",virginia
"But Mrs.
Hilbery was immediately sensitive to any silence in the drawing-room,
as of a dumb note in a sonorous scale, and leaning across the table she
observed, in the curiously tentative detached manner which always gave
her phrases the likeness of butterflies flaunting from one sunny spot
to another, “D’you know, Mr. Denham, you remind me so much of dear Mr.
Ruskin.... Is it his tie, Katharine, or his hair, or the way he sits in
his chair?",virginia
"Do tell me, Mr. Denham, are you an admirer of Ruskin?",virginia
"Some
one, the other day, said to me, ‘Oh, no, we don’t read Ruskin, Mrs.
Hilbery.’ What _do_ you read, I wonder?—for you can’t spend all your
time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the
earth.”

She looked benevolently at Denham, who said nothing articulate, and
then at Katharine, who smiled but said nothing either, upon which Mrs.
Hilbery seemed possessed by a brilliant idea, and exclaimed:

“I’m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things, Katharine.",virginia
"I’m sure
he’s not like that dreadful young man, Mr. Ponting, who told me that he
considered it our duty to live exclusively in the present.",virginia
"After all,
what IS the present?",virginia
"Half of it’s the past, and the better half, too, I
should say,” she added, turning to Mr. Fortescue.",virginia
"Denham rose, half meaning to go, and thinking that he had seen all that
there was to see, but Katharine rose at the same moment, and saying,
“Perhaps you would like to see the pictures,” led the way across the
drawing-room to a smaller room opening out of it.",virginia
"The smaller room was something like a chapel in a cathedral, or a
grotto in a cave, for the booming sound of the traffic in the distance
suggested the soft surge of waters, and the oval mirrors, with their
silver surface, were like deep pools trembling beneath starlight.",virginia
"But
the comparison to a religious temple of some kind was the more apt of
the two, for the little room was crowded with relics.",virginia
"As Katharine touched different spots, lights sprang here and there, and
revealed a square mass of red-and-gold books, and then a long skirt in
blue-and-white paint lustrous behind glass, and then a mahogany
writing-table, with its orderly equipment, and, finally, a picture
above the table, to which special illumination was accorded.",virginia
"When
Katharine had touched these last lights, she stood back, as much as to
say, “There!” Denham found himself looked down upon by the eyes of the
great poet, Richard Alardyce, and suffered a little shock which would
have led him, had he been wearing a hat, to remove it.",virginia
"The eyes looked
at him out of the mellow pinks and yellows of the paint with divine
friendliness, which embraced him, and passed on to contemplate the
entire world.",virginia
"The paint had so faded that very little but the beautiful
large eyes were left, dark in the surrounding dimness.",virginia
"Katharine waited as though for him to receive a full impression, and
then she said:

“This is his writing-table.",virginia
"He used this pen,” and she lifted a quill
pen and laid it down again.",virginia
"The writing-table was splashed with old
ink, and the pen disheveled in service.",virginia
"There lay the gigantic
gold-rimmed spectacles, ready to his hand, and beneath the table was a
pair of large, worn slippers, one of which Katharine picked up,
remarking:

“I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any
one is nowadays.",virginia
"This,” she went on, as if she knew what she had to say
by heart, “is the original manuscript of the ‘Ode to Winter.’ The early
poems are far less corrected than the later.",virginia
"Would you like to look at
it?”

While Mr. Denham examined the manuscript, she glanced up at her
grandfather, and, for the thousandth time, fell into a pleasant dreamy
state in which she seemed to be the companion of those giant men, of
their own lineage, at any rate, and the insignificant present moment
was put to shame.",virginia
"That magnificent ghostly head on the canvas, surely,
never beheld all the trivialities of a Sunday afternoon, and it did not
seem to matter what she and this young man said to each other, for they
were only small people.",virginia
"“This is a copy of the first edition of the poems,” she continued,
without considering the fact that Mr. Denham was still occupied with
the manuscript, “which contains several poems that have not been
reprinted, as well as corrections.” She paused for a minute, and then
went on, as if these spaces had all been calculated.",virginia
"“That lady in blue is my great-grandmother, by Millington.",virginia
"Here is my
uncle’s walking-stick—he was Sir Richard Warburton, you know, and rode
with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow.",virginia
"And then, let me see—oh, that’s
the original Alardyce, 1697, the founder of the family fortunes, with
his wife.",virginia
"Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their
crest and initials.",virginia
"We think it must have been given them to celebrate
their silver wedding-day.”

Here she stopped for a moment, wondering why it was that Mr. Denham
said nothing.",virginia
"Her feeling that he was antagonistic to her, which had
lapsed while she thought of her family possessions, returned so keenly
that she stopped in the middle of her catalog and looked at him.",virginia
"Her
mother, wishing to connect him reputably with the great dead, had
compared him with Mr. Ruskin; and the comparison was in Katharine’s
mind, and led her to be more critical of the young man than was fair,
for a young man paying a call in a tail-coat is in a different element
altogether from a head seized at its climax of expressiveness, gazing
immutably from behind a sheet of glass, which was all that remained to
her of Mr. Ruskin.",virginia
"He had a singular face—a face built for swiftness
and decision rather than for massive contemplation; the forehead broad,
the nose long and formidable, the lips clean-shaven and at once dogged
and sensitive, the cheeks lean, with a deeply running tide of red blood
in them.",virginia
"His eyes, expressive now of the usual masculine impersonality
and authority, might reveal more subtle emotions under favorable
circumstances, for they were large, and of a clear, brown color; they
seemed unexpectedly to hesitate and speculate; but Katharine only
looked at him to wonder whether his face would not have come nearer the
standard of her dead heroes if it had been adorned with side-whiskers.",virginia
"In his spare build and thin, though healthy, cheeks, she saw tokens of
an angular and acrid soul.",virginia
"His voice, she noticed, had a slight
vibrating or creaking sound in it, as he laid down the manuscript and
said:

“You must be very proud of your family, Miss Hilbery.”

“Yes, I am,” Katharine answered, and she added, “Do you think there’s
anything wrong in that?”

“Wrong?",virginia
How should it be wrong?,virginia
"It must be a bore, though, showing your
things to visitors,” he added reflectively.",virginia
"“Not if the visitors like them.”

“Isn’t it difficult to live up to your ancestors?” he proceeded.",virginia
"“I dare say I shouldn’t try to write poetry,” Katharine replied.",virginia
“No.,virginia
And that’s what I should hate.,virginia
"I couldn’t bear my grandfather to
cut me out.",virginia
"And, after all,” Denham went on, glancing round him
satirically, as Katharine thought, “it’s not your grandfather only.",virginia
You’re cut out all the way round.,virginia
"I suppose you come of one of the most
distinguished families in England.",virginia
"There are the Warburtons and the
Mannings—and you’re related to the Otways, aren’t you?",virginia
"I read it all in
some magazine,” he added.",virginia
"“The Otways are my cousins,” Katharine replied.",virginia
"“Well,” said Denham, in a final tone of voice, as if his argument were
proved.",virginia
"“Well,” said Katharine, “I don’t see that you’ve proved anything.”

Denham smiled, in a peculiarly provoking way.",virginia
"He was amused and
gratified to find that he had the power to annoy his oblivious,
supercilious hostess, if he could not impress her; though he would have
preferred to impress her.",virginia
"He sat silent, holding the precious little book of poems unopened in
his hands, and Katharine watched him, the melancholy or contemplative
expression deepening in her eyes as her annoyance faded.",virginia
"She appeared
to be considering many things.",virginia
She had forgotten her duties.,virginia
"“Well,” said Denham again, suddenly opening the little book of poems,
as though he had said all that he meant to say or could, with
propriety, say.",virginia
"He turned over the pages with great decision, as if he
were judging the book in its entirety, the printing and paper and
binding, as well as the poetry, and then, having satisfied himself of
its good or bad quality, he placed it on the writing-table, and
examined the malacca cane with the gold knob which had belonged to the
soldier.",virginia
“But aren’t you proud of your family?” Katharine demanded.,virginia
"“No,” said Denham.",virginia
"“We’ve never done anything to be proud of—unless you
count paying one’s bills a matter for pride.”

“That sounds rather dull,” Katharine remarked.",virginia
"“You would think us horribly dull,” Denham agreed.",virginia
"“Yes, I might find you dull, but I don’t think I should find you
ridiculous,” Katharine added, as if Denham had actually brought that
charge against her family.",virginia
“No—because we’re not in the least ridiculous.,virginia
"We’re a respectable
middle-class family, living at Highgate.”

“We don’t live at Highgate, but we’re middle class too, I suppose.”

Denham merely smiled, and replacing the malacca cane on the rack, he
drew a sword from its ornamental sheath.",virginia
"“That belonged to Clive, so we say,” said Katharine, taking up her
duties as hostess again automatically.",virginia
“Is it a lie?” Denham inquired.,virginia
“It’s a family tradition.,virginia
"I don’t know that we can prove it.”

“You see, we don’t have traditions in our family,” said Denham.",virginia
"“You sound very dull,” Katharine remarked, for the second time.",virginia
"“Merely middle class,” Denham replied.",virginia
"“You pay your bills, and you speak the truth.",virginia
"I don’t see why you
should despise us.”

Mr. Denham carefully sheathed the sword which the Hilberys said
belonged to Clive.",virginia
"“I shouldn’t like to be you; that’s all I said,” he replied, as if he
were saying what he thought as accurately as he could.",virginia
"“No, but one never would like to be any one else.”

“I should.",virginia
"I should like to be lots of other people.”

“Then why not us?” Katharine asked.",virginia
"Denham looked at her as she sat in her grandfather’s arm-chair, drawing
her great-uncle’s malacca cane smoothly through her fingers, while her
background was made up equally of lustrous blue-and-white paint, and
crimson books with gilt lines on them.",virginia
"The vitality and composure of
her attitude, as of a bright-plumed bird poised easily before further
flights, roused him to show her the limitations of her lot.",virginia
"So soon, so
easily, would he be forgotten.",virginia
"“You’ll never know anything at first hand,” he began, almost savagely.",virginia
“It’s all been done for you.,virginia
"You’ll never know the pleasure of buying
things after saving up for them, or reading books for the first time,
or making discoveries.”

“Go on,” Katharine observed, as he paused, suddenly doubtful, when he
heard his voice proclaiming aloud these facts, whether there was any
truth in them.",virginia
"“Of course, I don’t know how you spend your time,” he continued, a
little stiffly, “but I suppose you have to show people round.",virginia
"You are
writing a life of your grandfather, aren’t you?",virginia
"And this kind of
thing”—he nodded towards the other room, where they could hear bursts
of cultivated laughter—“must take up a lot of time.”

She looked at him expectantly, as if between them they were decorating
a small figure of herself, and she saw him hesitating in the
disposition of some bow or sash.",virginia
"“You’ve got it very nearly right,” she said, “but I only help my
mother.",virginia
"I don’t write myself.”

“Do you do anything yourself?” he demanded.",virginia
“What do you mean?” she asked.,virginia
"“I don’t leave the house at ten and come
back at six.”

“I don’t mean that.”

Mr. Denham had recovered his self-control; he spoke with a quietness
which made Katharine rather anxious that he should explain himself, but
at the same time she wished to annoy him, to waft him away from her on
some light current of ridicule or satire, as she was wont to do with
these intermittent young men of her father’s.",virginia
"“Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays,” she remarked.",virginia
"“You
see”—she tapped the volume of her grandfather’s poems—“we don’t even
print as well as they did, and as for poets or painters or
novelists—there are none; so, at any rate, I’m not singular.”

“No, we haven’t any great men,” Denham replied.",virginia
"“I’m very glad that we
haven’t.",virginia
I hate great men.,virginia
"The worship of greatness in the nineteenth
century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation.”

Katharine opened her lips and drew in her breath, as if to reply with
equal vigor, when the shutting of a door in the next room withdrew her
attention, and they both became conscious that the voices, which had
been rising and falling round the tea-table, had fallen silent; the
light, even, seemed to have sunk lower.",virginia
"A moment later Mrs. Hilbery
appeared in the doorway of the ante-room.",virginia
"She stood looking at them
with a smile of expectancy on her face, as if a scene from the drama of
the younger generation were being played for her benefit.",virginia
"She was a
remarkable-looking woman, well advanced in the sixties, but owing to
the lightness of her frame and the brightness of her eyes she seemed to
have been wafted over the surface of the years without taking much harm
in the passage.",virginia
"Her face was shrunken and aquiline, but any hint of
sharpness was dispelled by the large blue eyes, at once sagacious and
innocent, which seemed to regard the world with an enormous desire that
it should behave itself nobly, and an entire confidence that it could
do so, if it would only take the pains.",virginia
"Certain lines on the broad forehead and about the lips might be taken
to suggest that she had known moments of some difficulty and perplexity
in the course of her career, but these had not destroyed her
trustfulness, and she was clearly still prepared to give every one any
number of fresh chances and the whole system the benefit of the doubt.",virginia
"She wore a great resemblance to her father, and suggested, as he did,
the fresh airs and open spaces of a younger world.",virginia
"“Well,” she said, “how do you like our things, Mr. Denham?”

Mr. Denham rose, put his book down, opened his mouth, but said nothing,
as Katharine observed, with some amusement.",virginia
Mrs. Hilbery handled the book he had laid down.,virginia
"“There are some books that _live_,” she mused.",virginia
"“They are young with us,
and they grow old with us.",virginia
"Are you fond of poetry, Mr. Denham?",virginia
"But what
an absurd question to ask!",virginia
"The truth is, dear Mr. Fortescue has almost
tired me out.",virginia
"He is so eloquent and so witty, so searching and so
profound that, after half an hour or so, I feel inclined to turn out
all the lights.",virginia
"But perhaps he’d be more wonderful than ever in the
dark.",virginia
"What d’you think, Katharine?",virginia
"Shall we give a little party in
complete darkness?",virginia
"There’d have to be bright rooms for the bores....”

Here Mr. Denham held out his hand.",virginia
"“But we’ve any number of things to show you!” Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed,
taking no notice of it.",virginia
"“Books, pictures, china, manuscripts, and the
very chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of Darnley’s
murder.",virginia
"I must lie down for a little, and Katharine must change her
dress (though she’s wearing a very pretty one), but if you don’t mind
being left alone, supper will be at eight.",virginia
"I dare say you’ll write a
poem of your own while you’re waiting.",virginia
"Ah, how I love the firelight!",virginia
"Doesn’t our room look charming?”

She stepped back and bade them contemplate the empty drawing-room, with
its rich, irregular lights, as the flames leapt and wavered.",virginia
“Dear things!” she exclaimed.,virginia
“Dear chairs and tables!,virginia
"How like old
friends they are—faithful, silent friends.",virginia
"Which reminds me, Katharine,
little Mr. Anning is coming to-night, and Tite Street, and Cadogan
Square.... Do remember to get that drawing of your great-uncle glazed.",virginia
"Aunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here, and I know how it
would hurt me to see _my_ father in a broken glass.”

It was like tearing through a maze of diamond-glittering spiders’ webs
to say good-bye and escape, for at each movement Mrs. Hilbery
remembered something further about the villainies of picture-framers or
the delights of poetry, and at one time it seemed to the young man that
he would be hypnotized into doing what she pretended to want him to do,
for he could not suppose that she attached any value whatever to his
presence.",virginia
"Katharine, however, made an opportunity for him to leave, and
for that he was grateful to her, as one young person is grateful for
the understanding of another.",virginia
"CHAPTER II


The young man shut the door with a sharper slam than any visitor had
used that afternoon, and walked up the street at a great pace, cutting
the air with his walking-stick.",virginia
"He was glad to find himself outside
that drawing-room, breathing raw fog, and in contact with unpolished
people who only wanted their share of the pavement allowed them.",virginia
"He
thought that if he had had Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Hilbery out here he
would have made them, somehow, feel his superiority, for he was chafed
by the memory of halting awkward sentences which had failed to give
even the young woman with the sad, but inwardly ironical eyes a hint of
his force.",virginia
"He tried to recall the actual words of his little outburst,
and unconsciously supplemented them by so many words of greater
expressiveness that the irritation of his failure was somewhat
assuaged.",virginia
"Sudden stabs of the unmitigated truth assailed him now and
then, for he was not inclined by nature to take a rosy view of his
conduct, but what with the beat of his foot upon the pavement, and the
glimpse which half-drawn curtains offered him of kitchens,
dining-rooms, and drawing-rooms, illustrating with mute power different
scenes from different lives, his own experience lost its sharpness.",virginia
His own experience underwent a curious change.,virginia
"His speed slackened, his
head sank a little towards his breast, and the lamplight shone now and
again upon a face grown strangely tranquil.",virginia
"His thought was so
absorbing that when it became necessary to verify the name of a street,
he looked at it for a time before he read it; when he came to a
crossing, he seemed to have to reassure himself by two or three taps,
such as a blind man gives, upon the curb; and, reaching the Underground
station, he blinked in the bright circle of light, glanced at his
watch, decided that he might still indulge himself in darkness, and
walked straight on.",virginia
And yet the thought was the thought with which he had started.,virginia
"He was
still thinking about the people in the house which he had left; but
instead of remembering, with whatever accuracy he could, their looks
and sayings, he had consciously taken leave of the literal truth.",virginia
"A
turn of the street, a firelit room, something monumental in the
procession of the lamp-posts, who shall say what accident of light or
shape had suddenly changed the prospect within his mind, and led him to
murmur aloud:

“She’ll do....",virginia
"Yes, Katharine Hilbery’ll do.... I’ll take Katharine
Hilbery.”

As soon as he had said this, his pace slackened, his head fell, his
eyes became fixed.",virginia
"The desire to justify himself, which had been so
urgent, ceased to torment him, and, as if released from constraint, so
that they worked without friction or bidding, his faculties leapt
forward and fixed, as a matter of course, upon the form of Katharine
Hilbery.",virginia
"It was marvellous how much they found to feed upon,
considering the destructive nature of Denham’s criticism in her
presence.",virginia
"The charm, which he had tried to disown, when under the
effect of it, the beauty, the character, the aloofness, which he had
been determined not to feel, now possessed him wholly; and when, as
happened by the nature of things, he had exhausted his memory, he went
on with his imagination.",virginia
"He was conscious of what he was about, for in
thus dwelling upon Miss Hilbery’s qualities, he showed a kind of
method, as if he required this vision of her for a particular purpose.",virginia
"He increased her height, he darkened her hair; but physically there was
not much to change in her.",virginia
"His most daring liberty was taken with her
mind, which, for reasons of his own, he desired to be exalted and
infallible, and of such independence that it was only in the case of
Ralph Denham that it swerved from its high, swift flight, but where he
was concerned, though fastidious at first, she finally swooped from her
eminence to crown him with her approval.",virginia
"These delicious details,
however, were to be worked out in all their ramifications at his
leisure; the main point was that Katharine Hilbery would do; she would
do for weeks, perhaps for months.",virginia
"In taking her he had provided himself
with something the lack of which had left a bare place in his mind for
a considerable time.",virginia
"He gave a sigh of satisfaction; his consciousness
of his actual position somewhere in the neighborhood of Knightsbridge
returned to him, and he was soon speeding in the train towards
Highgate.",virginia
"Although thus supported by the knowledge of his new possession of
considerable value, he was not proof against the familiar thoughts
which the suburban streets and the damp shrubs growing in front gardens
and the absurd names painted in white upon the gates of those gardens
suggested to him.",virginia
"His walk was uphill, and his mind dwelt gloomily upon
the house which he approached, where he would find six or seven
brothers and sisters, a widowed mother, and, probably, some aunt or
uncle sitting down to an unpleasant meal under a very bright light.",virginia
"Should he put in force the threat which, two weeks ago, some such
gathering had wrung from him—the terrible threat that if visitors came
on Sunday he should dine alone in his room?",virginia
"A glance in the direction
of Miss Hilbery determined him to make his stand this very night, and
accordingly, having let himself in, having verified the presence of
Uncle Joseph by means of a bowler hat and a very large umbrella, he
gave his orders to the maid, and went upstairs to his room.",virginia
"He went up a great many flights of stairs, and he noticed, as he had
very seldom noticed, how the carpet became steadily shabbier, until it
ceased altogether, how the walls were discolored, sometimes by cascades
of damp, and sometimes by the outlines of picture-frames since removed,
how the paper flapped loose at the corners, and a great flake of
plaster had fallen from the ceiling.",virginia
"﻿CHAPTER I


As the streets that lead from the Strand to the Embankment are very
narrow, it is better not to walk down them arm-in-arm.",virginia
"If you persist,
lawyers’ clerks will have to make flying leaps into the mud; young lady
typists will have to fidget behind you.",virginia
"In the streets of London where
beauty goes unregarded, eccentricity must pay the penalty, and it is
better not to be very tall, to wear a long blue cloak, or to beat the
air with your left hand.",virginia
"One afternoon in the beginning of October when the traffic was becoming
brisk a tall man strode along the edge of the pavement with a lady on
his arm.",virginia
Angry glances struck upon their backs.,virginia
"The small, agitated
figures—for in comparison with this couple most people looked
small—decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes,
had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was
some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr.
Ambrose’s height and upon Mrs. Ambrose’s cloak.",virginia
"But some enchantment
had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity.",virginia
"In his case one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought;
and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a
level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow.",virginia
"It was only by
scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction
of people brushing past her was evidently painful.",virginia
"After watching the
traffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she
twitched her husband’s sleeve, and they crossed between the swift
discharge of motor cars.",virginia
"When they were safe on the further side, she
gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same time
to relax, to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on
the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious.",virginia
"Mr. Ambrose
attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs
of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that
was greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn
along the pavement.",virginia
"The embankment juts out in angles here and there, like pulpits; instead
of preachers, however, small boys occupy them, dangling string,
dropping pebbles, or launching wads of paper for a cruise.",virginia
"With their
sharp eye for eccentricity, they were inclined to think Mr. Ambrose
awful; but the quickest witted cried “Bluebeard!” as he passed.",virginia
"In case
they should proceed to tease his wife, Mr. Ambrose flourished his stick
at them, upon which they decided that he was grotesque merely, and four
instead of one cried “Bluebeard!” in chorus.",virginia
"Although Mrs. Ambrose stood quite still, much longer than is natural,
the little boys let her be.",virginia
"Some one is always looking into the river
near Waterloo Bridge; a couple will stand there talking for half an
hour on a fine afternoon; most people, walking for pleasure,
contemplate for three minutes; when, having compared the occasion with
other occasions, or made some sentence, they pass on.",virginia
"Sometimes the
flats and churches and hotels of Westminster are like the outlines of
Constantinople in a mist; sometimes the river is an opulent purple,
sometimes mud-coloured, sometimes sparkling blue like the sea.",virginia
"It is
always worth while to look down and see what is happening.",virginia
"But this
lady looked neither up nor down; the only thing she had seen, since she
stood there, was a circular iridescent patch slowly floating past with
a straw in the middle of it.",virginia
"The straw and the patch swam again and
again behind the tremulous medium of a great welling tear, and the tear
rose and fell and dropped into the river.",virginia
"Then there struck close upon
her ears—

Lars Porsena of Clusium
By the nine Gods he swore—


and then more faintly, as if the speaker had passed her on his walk—

That the Great House of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.",virginia
"Yes, she knew she must go back to all that, but at present she must
weep.",virginia
"Screening her face she sobbed more steadily than she had yet
done, her shoulders rising and falling with great regularity.",virginia
"It was
this figure that her husband saw when, having reached the polished
Sphinx, having entangled himself with a man selling picture postcards,
he turned; the stanza instantly stopped.",virginia
"He came up to her, laid his
hand on her shoulder, and said, “Dearest.” His voice was supplicating.",virginia
"But she shut her face away from him, as much as to say, “You can’t
possibly understand.”

As he did not leave her, however, she had to wipe her eyes, and to
raise them to the level of the factory chimneys on the other bank.",virginia
"She
saw also the arches of Waterloo Bridge and the carts moving across
them, like the line of animals in a shooting gallery.",virginia
"They were seen
blankly, but to see anything was of course to end her weeping and begin
to walk.",virginia
"“I would rather walk,” she said, her husband having hailed a cab
already occupied by two city men.",virginia
The fixity of her mood was broken by the action of walking.,virginia
"The
shooting motor cars, more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial
objects, the thundering drays, the jingling hansoms, and little black
broughams, made her think of the world she lived in.",virginia
"Somewhere up there
above the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed hill, her
children were now asking for her, and getting a soothing reply.",virginia
"As for
the mass of streets, squares, and public buildings which parted them,
she only felt at this moment how little London had done to make her
love it, although thirty of her forty years had been spent in a street.",virginia
"She knew how to read the people who were passing her; there were the
rich who were running to and from each others’ houses at this hour;
there were the bigoted workers driving in a straight line to their
offices; there were the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant.",virginia
"Already, though there was sunlight in the haze, tattered old men and
women were nodding off to sleep upon the seats.",virginia
"When one gave up seeing
the beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath.",virginia
"A fine rain now made her still more dismal; vans with the odd names of
those engaged in odd industries—Sprules, Manufacturer of Saw-dust;
Grabb, to whom no piece of waste paper comes amiss—fell flat as a bad
joke; bold lovers, sheltered behind one cloak, seemed to her sordid,
past their passion; the flower women, a contented company, whose talk
is always worth hearing, were sodden hags; the red, yellow, and blue
flowers, whose heads were pressed together, would not blaze.",virginia
"Moreover,
her husband walking with a quick rhythmic stride, jerking his free hand
occasionally, was either a Viking or a stricken Nelson; the sea-gulls
had changed his note.",virginia
"“Ridley, shall we drive?",virginia
"Shall we drive, Ridley?”

Mrs. Ambrose had to speak sharply; by this time he was far away.",virginia
"The cab, by trotting steadily along the same road, soon withdrew them
from the West End, and plunged them into London.",virginia
"It appeared that this
was a great manufacturing place, where the people were engaged in
making things, as though the West End, with its electric lamps, its
vast plate-glass windows all shining yellow, its carefully-finished
houses, and tiny live figures trotting on the pavement, or bowled along
on wheels in the road, was the finished work.",virginia
"It appeared to her a very
small bit of work for such an enormous factory to have made.",virginia
"For some
reason it appeared to her as a small golden tassel on the edge of a
vast black cloak.",virginia
"Observing that they passed no other hansom cab, but only vans and
waggons, and that not one of the thousand men and women she saw was
either a gentleman or a lady, Mrs. Ambrose understood that after all it
is the ordinary thing to be poor, and that London is the city of
innumerable poor people.",virginia
"Startled by this discovery and seeing herself
pacing a circle all the days of her life round Picadilly Circus she was
greatly relieved to pass a building put up by the London County Council
for Night Schools.",virginia
"“Lord, how gloomy it is!” her husband groaned.",virginia
"“Poor creatures!”

What with the misery for her children, the poor, and the rain, her mind
was like a wound exposed to dry in the air.",virginia
"At this point the cab stopped, for it was in danger of being crushed
like an egg-shell.",virginia
"The wide Embankment which had had room for
cannonballs and squadrons, had now shrunk to a cobbled lane steaming
with smells of malt and oil and blocked by waggons.",virginia
"While her husband
read the placards pasted on the brick announcing the hours at which
certain ships would sail for Scotland, Mrs. Ambrose did her best to
find information.",virginia
"From a world exclusively occupied in feeding waggons
with sacks, half obliterated too in a fine yellow fog, they got neither
help nor attention.",virginia
"It seemed a miracle when an old man approached,
guessed their condition, and proposed to row them out to their ship in
the little boat which he kept moored at the bottom of a flight of
steps.",virginia
"With some hesitation they trusted themselves to him, took their
places, and were soon waving up and down upon the water, London having
shrunk to two lines of buildings on either side of them, square
buildings and oblong buildings placed in rows like a child’s avenue of
bricks.",virginia
"The river, which had a certain amount of troubled yellow light in it,
ran with great force; bulky barges floated down swiftly escorted by
tugs; police boats shot past everything; the wind went with the
current.",virginia
"The open rowing-boat in which they sat bobbed and curtseyed
across the line of traffic.",virginia
"In mid-stream the old man stayed his hands
upon the oars, and as the water rushed past them, remarked that once he
had taken many passengers across, where now he took scarcely any.",virginia
"He
seemed to recall an age when his boat, moored among rushes, carried
delicate feet across to lawns at Rotherhithe.",virginia
"“They want bridges now,” he said, indicating the monstrous outline of
the Tower Bridge.",virginia
"Mournfully Helen regarded him, who was putting water
between her and her children.",virginia
"Mournfully she gazed at the ship they
were approaching; anchored in the middle of the stream they could dimly
read her name—_Euphrosyne_.",virginia
"Very dimly in the falling dusk they could see the lines of the rigging,
the masts and the dark flag which the breeze blew out squarely behind.",virginia
"As the little boat sidled up to the steamer, and the old man shipped
his oars, he remarked once more pointing above, that ships all the
world over flew that flag the day they sailed.",virginia
"In the minds of both the
passengers the blue flag appeared a sinister token, and this the moment
for presentiments, but nevertheless they rose, gathered their things
together, and climbed on deck.",virginia
"Down in the saloon of her father’s ship, Miss Rachel Vinrace, aged
twenty-four, stood waiting her uncle and aunt nervously.",virginia
"To begin with,
though nearly related, she scarcely remembered them; to go on with,
they were elderly people, and finally, as her father’s daughter she
must be in some sort prepared to entertain them.",virginia
"She looked forward to
seeing them as civilised people generally look forward to the first
sight of civilised people, as though they were of the nature of an
approaching physical discomfort—a tight shoe or a draughty window.",virginia
"She
was already unnaturally braced to receive them.",virginia
"As she occupied herself
in laying forks severely straight by the side of knives, she heard a
man’s voice saying gloomily:

“On a dark night one would fall down these stairs head foremost,” to
which a woman’s voice added, “And be killed.”

As she spoke the last words the woman stood in the doorway.",virginia
"Tall,
large-eyed, draped in purple shawls, Mrs. Ambrose was romantic and
beautiful; not perhaps sympathetic, for her eyes looked straight and
considered what they saw.",virginia
"Her face was much warmer than a Greek face;
on the other hand it was much bolder than the face of the usual pretty
Englishwoman.",virginia
"“Oh, Rachel, how d’you do,” she said, shaking hands.",virginia
"“How are you, dear,” said Mr. Ambrose, inclining his forehead to be
kissed.",virginia
"His niece instinctively liked his thin angular body, and the
big head with its sweeping features, and the acute, innocent eyes.",virginia
"“Tell Mr. Pepper,” Rachel bade the servant.",virginia
"Husband and wife then sat
down on one side of the table, with their niece opposite to them.",virginia
"“My father told me to begin,” she explained.",virginia
"“He is very busy with the
men.",virginia
.,virginia
.,virginia
.,virginia
"You know Mr. Pepper?”

A little man who was bent as some trees are by a gale on one side of
them had slipped in.",virginia
"Nodding to Mr. Ambrose, he shook hands with Helen.",virginia
"“Draughts,” he said, erecting the collar of his coat.",virginia
“You are still rheumatic?” asked Helen.,virginia
"Her voice was low and
seductive, though she spoke absently enough, the sight of town and
river being still present to her mind.",virginia
"“Once rheumatic, always rheumatic, I fear,” he replied.",virginia
"“To some extent
it depends on the weather, though not so much as people are apt to
think.”

“One does not die of it, at any rate,” said Helen.",virginia
"“As a general rule—no,” said Mr. Pepper.",virginia
"“Soup, Uncle Ridley?” asked Rachel.",virginia
"“Thank you, dear,” he said, and, as he held his plate out, sighed
audibly, “Ah!",virginia
"she’s not like her mother.” Helen was just too late in
thumping her tumbler on the table to prevent Rachel from hearing, and
from blushing scarlet with embarrassment.",virginia
“The way servants treat flowers!” she said hastily.,virginia
"She drew a green
vase with a crinkled lip towards her, and began pulling out the tight
little chrysanthemums, which she laid on the table-cloth, arranging
them fastidiously side by side.",virginia
There was a pause.,virginia
"“You knew Jenkinson, didn’t you, Ambrose?” asked Mr. Pepper across the
table.",virginia
"“Jenkinson of Peterhouse?”

“He’s dead,” said Mr. Pepper.",virginia
"“Ah, dear!—I knew him—ages ago,” said Ridley.",virginia
"“He was the hero of the
punt accident, you remember?",virginia
A queer card.,virginia
"Married a young woman out of
a tobacconist’s, and lived in the Fens—never heard what became of him.”

“Drink—drugs,” said Mr. Pepper with sinister conciseness.",virginia
"“He left a
commentary.",virginia
"Hopeless muddle, I’m told.”

“The man had really great abilities,” said Ridley.",virginia
"“His introduction to Jellaby holds its own still,” went on Mr. Pepper,
“which is surprising, seeing how text-books change.”

“There was a theory about the planets, wasn’t there?” asked Ridley.",virginia
"“A screw loose somewhere, no doubt of it,” said Mr. Pepper, shaking his
head.",virginia
"Now a tremor ran through the table, and a light outside swerved.",virginia
"At the
same time an electric bell rang sharply again and again.",virginia
"“We’re off,” said Ridley.",virginia
"A slight but perceptible wave seemed to roll beneath the floor; then it
sank; then another came, more perceptible.",virginia
"Lights slid right across the
uncurtained window.",virginia
The ship gave a loud melancholy moan.,virginia
“We’re off!” said Mr. Pepper.,virginia
"Other ships, as sad as she, answered her
outside on the river.",virginia
"The chuckling and hissing of water could be
plainly heard, and the ship heaved so that the steward bringing plates
had to balance himself as he drew the curtain.",virginia
There was a pause.,virginia
“Jenkinson of Cats—d’you still keep up with him?” asked Ambrose.,virginia
"“As much as one ever does,” said Mr. Pepper.",virginia
“We meet annually.,virginia
"This
year he has had the misfortune to lose his wife, which made it painful,
of course.”

“Very painful,” Ridley agreed.",virginia
"“There’s an unmarried daughter who keeps house for him, I believe, but
it’s never the same, not at his age.”

Both gentlemen nodded sagely as they carved their apples.",virginia
"“There was a book, wasn’t there?” Ridley enquired.",virginia
"“There _was_ a book, but there never _will_ be a book,” said Mr. Pepper
with such fierceness that both ladies looked up at him.",virginia
"“There never will be a book, because some one else has written it for
him,” said Mr. Pepper with considerable acidity.",virginia
"“That’s what comes of
putting things off, and collecting fossils, and sticking Norman arches
on one’s pigsties.”

“I confess I sympathise,” said Ridley with a melancholy sigh.",virginia
"“I have a
weakness for people who can’t begin.”

“.",virginia
.,virginia
.,virginia
"The accumulations of a lifetime wasted,” continued Mr. pepper.",virginia
"“He had accumulations enough to fill a barn.”

“It’s a vice that some of us escape,” said Ridley.",virginia
"“Our friend Miles
has another work out to-day.”

Mr. Pepper gave an acid little laugh.",virginia
"“According to my calculations,”
he said, “he has produced two volumes and a half annually, which,
allowing for time spent in the cradle and so forth, shows a commendable
industry.”

“Yes, the old Master’s saying of him has been pretty well realised,”
said Ridley.",virginia
"“A way they had,” said Mr. Pepper.",virginia
"“You know the Bruce collection?—not
for publication, of course.”

“I should suppose not,” said Ridley significantly.",virginia
"“For a Divine he
was—remarkably free.”

“The Pump in Neville’s Row, for example?” enquired Mr. Pepper.",virginia
"“Precisely,” said Ambrose.",virginia
"Each of the ladies, being after the fashion of their sex, highly
trained in promoting men’s talk without listening to it, could
think—about the education of children, about the use of fog sirens in
an opera—without betraying herself.",virginia
"Only it struck Helen that Rachel
was perhaps too still for a hostess, and that she might have done
something with her hands.",virginia
"“Perhaps—?” she said at length, upon which they rose and left, vaguely
to the surprise of the gentlemen, who had either thought them attentive
or had forgotten their presence.",virginia
"“Ah, one could tell strange stories of the old days,” they heard Ridley
say, as he sank into his chair again.",virginia
"Glancing back, at the doorway,
they saw Mr. Pepper as though he had suddenly loosened his clothes, and
had become a vivacious and malicious old ape.",virginia
"Winding veils round their heads, the women walked on deck.",virginia
"They were
now moving steadily down the river, passing the dark shapes of ships at
anchor, and London was a swarm of lights with a pale yellow canopy
drooping above it.",virginia
"There were the lights of the great theatres, the
lights of the long streets, lights that indicated huge squares of
domestic comfort, lights that hung high in air.",virginia
"No darkness would ever
settle upon those lamps, as no darkness had settled upon them for
hundreds of years.",virginia
"It seemed dreadful that the town should blaze for
ever in the same spot; dreadful at least to people going away to
adventure upon the sea, and beholding it as a circumscribed mound,
eternally burnt, eternally scarred.",virginia
"From the deck of the ship the great
city appeared a crouched and cowardly figure, a sedentary miser.",virginia
"Leaning over the rail, side by side, Helen said, “Won’t you be cold?”
Rachel replied, “No.",virginia
.,virginia
.,virginia
.,virginia
How beautiful!” she added a moment later.,virginia
"Very little was visible—a few masts, a shadow of land here, a line of
brilliant windows there.",virginia
They tried to make head against the wind.,virginia
"“It blows—it blows!” gasped Rachel, the words rammed down her throat.",virginia
"Struggling by her side, Helen was suddenly overcome by the spirit of
movement, and pushed along with her skirts wrapping themselves round
her knees, and both arms to her hair.",virginia
"But slowly the intoxication of
movement died down, and the wind became rough and chilly.",virginia
"They looked
through a chink in the blind and saw that long cigars were being smoked
in the dining-room; they saw Mr. Ambrose throw himself violently
against the back of his chair, while Mr. Pepper crinkled his cheeks as
though they had been cut in wood.",virginia
"The ghost of a roar of laughter came
out to them, and was drowned at once in the wind.",virginia
"In the dry
yellow-lighted room Mr. Pepper and Mr. Ambrose were oblivious of all
tumult; they were in Cambridge, and it was probably about the year
1875.",virginia
"“They’re old friends,” said Helen, smiling at the sight.",virginia
"“Now, is there
a room for us to sit in?”

Rachel opened a door.",virginia
"“It’s more like a landing than a room,” she said.",virginia
"Indeed it had nothing
of the shut stationary character of a room on shore.",virginia
"A table was rooted
in the middle, and seats were stuck to the sides.",virginia
"Happily the tropical
suns had bleached the tapestries to a faded blue-green colour, and the
mirror with its frame of shells, the work of the steward’s love, when
the time hung heavy in the southern seas, was quaint rather than ugly.",virginia
"Twisted shells with red lips like unicorn’s horns ornamented the
mantelpiece, which was draped by a pall of purple plush from which
depended a certain number of balls.",virginia
"Two windows opened on to the deck,
and the light beating through them when the ship was roasted on the
Amazons had turned the prints on the opposite wall to a faint yellow
colour, so that “The Coliseum” was scarcely to be distinguished from
Queen Alexandra playing with her Spaniels.",virginia
"A pair of wicker arm-chairs
by the fireside invited one to warm one’s hands at a grate full of gilt
shavings; a great lamp swung above the table—the kind of lamp which
makes the light of civilisation across dark fields to one walking in
the country.",virginia
"“It’s odd that every one should be an old friend of Mr. Pepper’s,”
Rachel started nervously, for the situation was difficult, the room
cold, and Helen curiously silent.",virginia
“I suppose you take him for granted?” said her aunt.,virginia
"“He’s like this,” said Rachel, lighting on a fossilised fish in a
basin, and displaying it.",virginia
"“I expect you’re too severe,” Helen remarked.",virginia
"Rachel immediately tried to qualify what she had said against her
belief.",virginia
"“I don’t really know him,” she said, and took refuge in facts,
believing that elderly people really like them better than feelings.",virginia
She produced what she knew of William Pepper.,virginia
"She told Helen that he
always called on Sundays when they were at home; he knew about a great
many things—about mathematics, history, Greek, zoology, economics, and
the Icelandic Sagas.",virginia
"He had turned Persian poetry into English prose,
and English prose into Greek iambics; he was an authority upon coins;
and—one other thing—oh yes, she thought it was vehicular traffic.",virginia
"He was here either to get things out of the sea, or to write upon the
probable course of Odysseus, for Greek after all was his hobby.",virginia
"“I’ve got all his pamphlets,” she said.",virginia
“Little pamphlets.,virginia
"Little
yellow books.” It did not appear that she had read them.",virginia
"“Has he ever been in love?” asked Helen, who had chosen a seat.",virginia
This was unexpectedly to the point.,virginia
"“His heart’s a piece of old shoe leather,” Rachel declared, dropping
the fish.",virginia

So wither’d, and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth,

By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips.",william

Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show?",william
"My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal.",william
To me you speak not.,william

"By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor?",william
"The Thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,

You owe this strange intelligence?",william

Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting?—Speak, I charge you.",william

BANQUO.",william

Who’s here?,william
Enter Ross and Angus.,william
ROSS.,william
"The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,
The news of thy success, and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenc’d with that,
In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death.",william
"As thick as tale
Came post with post; and everyone did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defence,
And pour’d them down before him.",william
ANGUS.,william
"We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight,
Not pay thee.",william
ROSS.,william
"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
For it is thine.",william
BANQUO.,william
"What, can the devil speak true?",william
MACBETH.,william
"The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow’d robes?",william
ANGUS.,william
"Who was the Thane lives yet,
But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose.",william
"Whether he was combin’d
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
He labour’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;
But treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,
Have overthrown him.",william
MACBETH.,william
"[_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:
The greatest is behind.",william
[_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.,william
"[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promis’d no less to them?",william
BANQUO.,william
"That, trusted home,
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the Thane of Cawdor.",william
"But ’tis strange:
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;
Win us with honest trifles, to betray’s
In deepest consequence.—
Cousins, a word, I pray you.",william
MACBETH.,william
"[_Aside._] Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.—
[_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill; cannot be good.",william
"If ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth?",william
